        "text": "\nThe National Universities Commission said “concerns expressed on the security of staff, students and properties of our respective institutions,” were a factor in the decision, in a letter to universities signed by Chris Maiyaki, its deputy executive secretary.\nOn Feb. 25, \nThe decision to close the country’s more than 200 universities from Feb. 22 to March 14 followed “extensive consultations with the relevant security agencies,” Maiyaki said.\nNigeria is battling various armed groups in its northwest and southeast, while overstretched security forces continue to fight decade-long extremist violence in the northeast. In recent years, gunmen have targeted universities in the troubled northern region, with hundreds of students abducted and later freed — sometimes in exchange for ransoms.\nIn addition to ensuring the safety of students, the university closure will also let students enrolled at faculties in other parts of the country return where they're registered to vote, Haruna Lawal Ajo, the university commission's director of public affairs, told The Associated Press. Nigeria’s electoral law doesn't allow people to vote away from where they're registered.\nWith students comprising 28% of the electorate, the planned closure could boost election-day turnout that has been low in previous voting. Only 34% of eligible voters cast their ballots in the 2019 presidential election, the lowest turnout since Nigeria returned to democratic rule in 1999.\n\"Most of the students are above 18 and have vote cards, they can exercise their civic right,” Ajo said."
