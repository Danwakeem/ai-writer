This project was built using [serverless](https://serverless.com), [step functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/?ef_id=Cj0KCQiAorKfBhC0ARIsAHDzsluwi8mi2ojES04-shkq93zxRx27xuHNITp3cApxHCQcqN86XAu8dZEaAjA1EALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!629393325316!!!g!!), [this next.js template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), and a little bit of elbow grease.

This project was built for fun to go along with some research I was doing for writing [this article](https://medium.com/@danwakeem/hugging-face-deep-dive-a431a4e1c7e5).
