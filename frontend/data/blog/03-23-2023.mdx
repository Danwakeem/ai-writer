## State's Top Accountant Resigns After Controversial Financial Error
South Carolina's Comptroller General, Richard Eckstrom, will be leaving his elected post after 20 years following the state's recent financial oversight blunder. The controversy arose after it was revealed that the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report overstated the state's cash position by double counting money. The lack of concern for auditing took over six years to gain attention but Senate officials solely held Eckstrom responsible for the error. This placed Eckstrom under much scrutiny and led to his ultimate resignation after the occurrence of such claims being made. He has suggested the position should now be appointed by the governor and that the associated agency's duties be transferred to other departments.

## Black residents file federal lawsuit against Louisiana parish for environmental racism
Residents of a predominantly Black neighborhood in St. James Parish, known as “Cancer Alley” due to its high concentration of petrochemical plants, filed a federal lawsuit against the local government for environmental racism. The lawsuit seeks a moratorium on new petrochemical plants in Black districts of St. James Parish and other relief, while alleging that petrochemical plants have caused severe forms of racial discrimination that are illegal. The lawsuit was filed by two environmental organizations and local residents, with the support of the Center for Constitutional Rights and Tulane University Law School. The EPA has released a letter warning about disproportionate cancer risks for Black Americans, which has not been addressed by local or state officials.

## 22-year-old woman arrested for setting fire to Wyoming clinic offering women's healthcare
Lorna Roxanne Green has been arrested by authorities after she confessed to breaking into a women's healthcare clinic on May 25th and setting it on fire. The clinic was set to open last summer as the only such facility in the state offering women's healthcare.

## Hungarian chief of staff says arresting Putin would violate country's law
The chief of staff for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Gergely Gulyas, stated that arresting Russian President Vladimir Putin would go against Hungarian law since the country has not included the statute of the International Criminal Court in its legal system. Gulyas mentioned that taking Putin into custody would contradict Hungary’s Constitution and considered the warrant counterproductive, promoting conflict rather than peace. The Russian President could be limited in travelling across the tribunal's 123 member countries but would not face a trial since Moscow does not admit the ICC's jurisdiction or extradite its nationals. Hungary has refused to supply weapons to Ukraine or to permit the transfer through its borders and has opposed certain EU sanctions against Russia.

## North Carolina to Expand Medicaid After Years of Opposition
North Carolina, a Republican-led state, is set to expand Medicaid, despite years of opposition. The move will leave only 10 states in the US that haven’t adopted the policy. The expansion could help 600,000 adults, according to advocates. The legislation can’t go into effect until after a state budget is approved, which usually happens in the early summer, despite Governor Roy Cooper’s support. The state’s 10% share of expenses for Medicaid expansion recipients would be paid through hospital assessments, with the program’s proceeds set to help ailing rural hospitals. Hospitals are also expected to receive larger reimbursements for treating Medicaid patients through a federal programme. Advocates have urged lawmakers to expand Medicaid to improve the overall health of North Carolina’s citizens while also strengthening the state's economy.
