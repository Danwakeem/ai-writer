## LGBTQ group issues travel advisory for Florida over anti-LGBT laws
Equality Florida, the state's largest LGBTQ civil rights group, has issued a travel advisory for the State of Florida due to the passage of laws that are hostile to the community. The organization is urging families to consider relocation, asking students to reconsider attending colleges and universities in the state and recommending that conference and event hosts relocate out of the state. Other organizations representing marginalized groups in the state, including the Florida Immigrant Coalition and the Florida chapters of the NAACP have issued similar travel advisories.

## Federal Reserve Staff Concerned About Potential Mild Recession Later This Year
Economists at the Federal Reserve are projecting a mild recession later this year, following recent banking-sector developments. This outlook is dimmer than public statements from Chairman Jerome Powell and contradicts the opinion of the White House press secretary, who argues that economic indicators show the country is not headed towards a recession. Despite the troubling outlook, the central bank aims to curb inflation, as February saw a year-over-year inflation of 6%.

## Delta predicts bigger Q2 profit despite Q1 loss
Delta Air Lines reported a loss of $363m in Q1, but predicts a bigger-than-expected profit in Q2. CEO Ed Bastian said that bookings for Q2 are strong and expects passenger-carrying capacity to grow by mid-double digits, with revenue along a similar pattern. Despite reports of economic tremors, Bastian says that many customers are still eager to travel post-pandemic. Corporate travel has returned only to 85% of pre-pandemic levels, but some of it will never return as people who aren’t working in the office are taking more work-leisure blended trips.

Jury selection is due to begin in the trial of the man accused of the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in US history. Robert Bowers is charged with murdering 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018.
