## Biden to Sign Executive Order Changing Military Handling of Sexual Assault Cases
U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a historic executive order that transfers decision-making powers in sexual assault cases from commanders to independent military prosecutors. This will mark the most significant transformation in the U.S. military justice system since its establishment in 1950. The reforms fulfill Biden's promise to shift how the military justice system responds to sexual assault and related crimes. The changes are based on recommendations from a 2021 report on sexual assault in the military.
