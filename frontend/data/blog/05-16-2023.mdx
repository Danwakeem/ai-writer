## Former associate files lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani over alleged sexual misconduct and wage theft
Noelle Dunphy is suing Rudy Giuliani for alleged sexual assault, harassment, wage theft, and other misconduct. Dunphy claims that Giuliani made 'sexual demands' and was known for his sexist, racist, and antisemitic remarks towards her, many of which were recorded. Dunphy also claims that she was promised a $1 million annual salary, but the offer came with a catch.

## Beijing LGBT Center shuts down amid China's crackdown on LGBTQ+ advocacy groups
The Beijing LGBT Center, a prominent Chinese advocacy group for the LGBTQ+ community, has been forced to stop operating due to pressure from government authorities. This is part of a wider crackdown on LGBTQ+ groups that has been ongoing for several years, resulting in the closure of other advocacy groups and the detainment of their founders. Police pressure on these groups has increased, with repeated 'tea' meetings and harassment, leading to many groups not being able to inform the community about events. The center had recently celebrated 15 years of work, and its shutdown is being seen as a significant blow to the LGBTQ+ movement in China.
