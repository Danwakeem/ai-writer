At least 34 people have died and thousands have been evacuated as wildfires continue to rage across northern Algeria. The fires, fueled by high temperatures and strong winds, have spread across 16 provinces and have been burning for several days.

The shakeup does not immediately signal a change in foreign policy, but follows recent diplomatic efforts by the US in hopes of improving relations with China.

## Israeli newspapers cover front pages in black ink as protests against judicial overhaul continue
The Israeli government's controversial judicial overhaul, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has faced fierce opposition from civil rights groups and citizens. Despite protests and warnings from the United States, the bill was unanimously passed by the governing coalition. Demonstrations and clashes with police have erupted nationwide, with concern over the potential social, political, and international consequences of the overhaul. Physicians have announced mass strikes, and the largest labor union is planning a general strike. The Supreme Court may face a constitutional crisis if it challenges the law. Supporters believe the powers of unelected judges should be curbed, while opponents argue it undermines democracy and checks on majority rule.

## Russian lawmakers approve bill to expand military draft
Russian lawmakers have approved a bill to expand the military draft, which currently requires all men aged 18-27 to serve for one year. The bill, if signed into law by President Vladimir Putin, would raise the draft age to 18-30 starting next year. This move is seen as an effort to bolster the Russian army as it continues to face a counteroffensive in Ukraine. The military claims to rely on volunteers and reservists for the fighting, but reports suggest they try to encourage draft evaders to sign up as volunteers.
