## Poland to Provide Fighter Jets to Ukraine Amid Russia-Ukraine Tensions
Poland will hand over four Soviet-made warplanes to Ukraine within the next few days, as a crucial ally in the Ukraine crisis. The planes are in good working condition and the rest will be supplied later. Other countries, including Slovakia, have pledged to send their disused MiGs to Ukraine. Poland's air force will replace the planes it gives to Ukraine with South Korea-made FA-50 fighters and American-made F-35s.

## French Government risks collapse as flagship Macron legislation's fate hangs in the balance
Despite major strikes and protests against the move, French President Emmanuel Macron wants to increase the retirement age so workers contribute more to the system to prevent a deficit. The bill was passed in the Senate in another contentious vote over raising the retirement age but was met with opposition by leftist members of the lower chamber who disrupted proceedings by breaking into the Marseillaise, before the process was eventually suspended. The government risks a no-confidence motion if it cannot successfully pass the bill.

## Jobless claims in the US fall despite Fed's efforts to cool economy
Jobless claims in the US dropped by 20,000 to 192,000 for the week of March 11, 2019, the Labor Department reported. The four-week moving average of claims also fell by 750, staying below the 200,000 rate for the eighth consecutive week. Although some analysts predict job cuts due to layoff announcements, there are no signs that unemployment is on the rise. Many laid-off individuals are quickly finding new jobs, reflecting a strong labor demand. The Fed's interest rate hikes have yet to have a cooling effect on the economy, labor market, and wages, as prices continue to rise. There are speculations that the Fed could raise the rate by another 25 basis points, though recent events may lead officials to be more cautious.

Contrary to previous reports, local media has now stated the fire did not result from the detonation of ammunition stored in a warehouse.

## Missing uranium in Libya raises concerns over proliferation
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that 10 drums of uranium ore concentrate totalling approximately 2.5 tonnes are missing from a declared site in Libya. This natural uranium could be converted to weapons-grade fuel if refined over time, making the IAEA's discovery - and search for the material - critical for nonproliferation experts. One possible location for the uranium is Sabha, once a logistics hub for dictator Moammar Qadhafi's uranium efforts, but now a city under the control of self-styled Libyan National Army leader Khalifa Hifter. The IAEA has declined to share further information on the missing uranium, which was disclosed to member states yesterday by Rafael Mariano Grossi, its Director-General.
