## U.S. economy slows down despite investments, consumer spending and government funding
The U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease from the previous quarter's 2.6% and 3.2%. The decline was seen in business and home buying and construction investments. Despite a rise in consumer spending and federal funding, the economy remains under threat of a recession. Sixty-five percent of economists predict a recession within a year.

## US Jobless Claims Drop Despite Economic Uncertainty
According to Labor Department reports, applications for jobless claims in the US fell by 16,000 to 230,000 for the week ending April 22nd, indicating that the state of the labor market remains resilient despite other weak spots in the economy: the job market currently shows noticeable job security for American workers in spite of fears of a looming recession, rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. The Federal Reserve Bank, on the other hand, raised their benchmark interest rate in order to lower growth just enough so as to bring inflation under control but not cause a recession.

## Montana House votes to censure politician who opposed ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth
Montana's first transgender legislator, Representative Zephyr, has been censured by the House after she opposed a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The bill in question, SB99, would restrict the use of hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and surgeries for people under the age of 18 for the purposes of gender transitioning. Zephyr, who had previously stated that lawmakers who passed the bill would have 'blood on their hands', has been expelled from the House floor, and calls the decision an attempt to silence her. At least 12 other states including Alabama, Arkansas, and Tennessee have passed similar policies that restrict gender-affirming care for minors.

## Federal appeals panel clears way for Mike Pence to testify before special counsel
A three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected former President Donald Trump's effort to prevent former Vice President Mike Pence from testifying before the special counsel. The order would allow Pence to testify before special counsel Jack Smith should Trump's legal team not seek further appeal before the full Circuit or the Supreme Court.
