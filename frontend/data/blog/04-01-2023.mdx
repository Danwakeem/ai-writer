## Judge rules Dominion Voting Systems' lawsuit against Fox News can proceed to trial
A Delaware Superior Court Judge ruled on Friday that Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News can proceed to trial. Fox attorneys tried to have the suit dismissed, arguing that their election fraud claims were newsworthy and a matter of opinion. The judge found Dominion's legal claims compelling enough to present to jurors at trial and ruled that the statements Fox presented were false. However, the issue of actual malice and damages will head to the jury.

## Goodbye Blue Check Marks: Twitter Users Who Don't Subscribe to Twitter Blue Will Lose That Status
Twitter blue check marks were originally intended to verify the authenticity of high-profile accounts, but now any user who pays a monthly subscription fee to Twitter Blue automatically gets a check mark regardless of account relevancy. Starting April 1, 2023, existing blue check accounts that don't subscribe to Twitter Blue will have to pay or lose the check, as part of an attempt to cut down on automated spam accounts, but this leaves the door open to impersonation and misinformation on the platform.

## Senator John Fetterman reveals mental health struggles, depression in remission
Pennsylvania's Senator John Fetterman reveals that his depression is now in remission and he is back home in Braddock; the latest medical episode for the Democrat, who won last fall's most expensive Senate contest after suffering a stroke that he has said nearly killed him and from which he continues to recover. Doctors describe “remission” as when a patient responds to treatment so that they have returned to normal social function and they are indistinguishable from someone who has never had depression.

## NBA, players reach agreement on seven-year CBA to begin this summer
The NBA and its players have agreed on a new seven-year collective bargaining agreement that will begin this summer and last until at least the 2028-29 season. The agreement includes the in-season tournament that commissioner Adam Silver has wanted for years, and players will have to appear in at least 65 games to be eligible for the top individual awards. A second luxury tax level will prevent teams from using their midlevel exception to sign players, and no change to policies allowing high school players to enter the draft will be made. The deal is pending ratification by both sides, then the writing of the 600-page document containing 5,000 paragraphs and 200,000 words.

## Time is running out for Social Security as trust funds projected to run short by 2034
Social Security's trust funds for retirees, survivors, and the disabled are projected to run out of funds by 2034, leaving only 80% of scheduled benefits being covered. This brings to light a political battle over the budget and debt ceiling; however, President Joe Biden has a limited plan to shore up Social Security's finances without cutting benefits or raising taxes for those making under $400,000 annually. The Republican Study Committee has proposed raising the retirement age and trimming auxiliary benefits. Congress must act quickly to save the program's future generations.
