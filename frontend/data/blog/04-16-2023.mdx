## Gunfire and Fighting Breaks Out in Sudanese Capital Amid Tensions Over Civilian Rule
Gunfire and fighting erupted between the Sudanese army and paramilitary group, Rapid Support Forces (RSF), in Khartoum amid tensions over a proposed transition to civilian rule. The RSF later said it had taken control of the Khartoum International Airport, presidential palace and the chief army general's residence, but the army said it’s carrying out its duty to safeguard the country. Tensions between the military and RSF stem from a disagreement over how the RSF should be integrated into the military, a key condition of Sudan's unsigned transition agreement. US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, urged all actors to avoid further escalation and said this is a real opportunity to finally carry forward the civilian-led transition.

## Cars Derailed and Caught Fire in Rural Maine
Several cars carrying lumber and electrical wiring derailed and caught fire on a freight train, causing a small forest fire in rural Maine. The three railroad employees were taken to the hospital, but their injuries were not life-threatening. The cause is possibly due to melting ice and debris that washed out part of the railroad track. There were some hazardous materials on board, but officials confirmed they were not involved in the fire. The village where the derailment happened has about 300 residents and is a destination for salmon and trout fishing.

Attorneys for Children's Mercy Hospital filed a lawsuit in Jackson County to deny the 54 investigative demands for records and testimony from Missouri's Attorney General, Eric Schmitt, who is investigating gender-affirming care practices in state hospitals. Releasing the information would violate state and federal laws with Bailey having no jurisdiction to investigate health care companies and physicians. The hospital is now embroiled in a legal battle with the Attorney General, who has imposed restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors.

## Report Shows Increase in Hate Crimes and Black History Suppression Across the US
The annual State of Black America report from the National Urban League shows an increase in hate crimes, censorship, and Black history suppression across the US. The report draws on data from a number of organizations, revealing attempts to make voting more difficult, extremist views becoming normalized in politics and law enforcement, and the censoring of classroom curriculums. Critical race theory (CRT) is one of the prominent areas examined in the report. Scholars developed CRT as an academic framework in response to a lack of racial progress following the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. It centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation's institutions and that they function to maintain the dominance of white people in society. The report shows that 209 local, state, and federal government entities have introduced more than 670 bills, resolutions, executive orders, opinion letters, statements, and other measures against CRT since September 2020. These laws are having a chilling effect on the teaching of certain aspects of the country's racial conflicts. It will ultimately lead to major gaps in understanding history and social justice, which will frustrate multiracial democracy.
