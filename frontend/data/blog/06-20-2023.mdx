## Total Giving Fell 3.4% in 2022 Despite Increased Need
Charitable giving fell 3.4% in 2022 to $499.3 billion in current dollars, but considering the tough economic climate of late 2022, results were better than expected. The downturn in giving has led to issues at Community Help in Park Slope and other charities, with many operating on less donations while inflation rises. Despite the decline, charitable giving has grown, though fewer people are participating. Nonprofits have had to come up with new solutions to battle inflation’s effects on their resources. They include engaging individual donors and appealing to them for help and seeking help from travel industry partners and looking for donations of airline miles and hotel points. The report revealed that 64% of donations in 2022 came from individual donors, 21% from foundations, 9% from bequests, and 6% from corporations.
