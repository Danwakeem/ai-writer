## Private insurers refuse coverage for Alzheimer's drug Leqembi
Private insurers in several states, including North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New York, have stated that they will not cover the drug Leqembi, which is the first drug approved by the FDA to slow mental decline in Alzheimer's patients. Insurers consider the drug experimental despite its full approval by the FDA. This decision contrasts with Medicare, which will cover most patients taking Leqembi. The drug is mainly covered by Medicare, with about 76% of patients being eligible. However, patients under 65 with commercial coverage are left without coverage for the drug, leading to concerns of discrimination. Some insurers, such as Highmark and Blue Cross-Blue Shield, are still monitoring the drug and may reconsider their decision. Other insurers, like Kaiser Permanente and Elevance Health, will cover the drug. The cost and side effects of Leqembi have contributed to insurers' reluctance to cover it. Patients may be able to receive coverage through Medicare or Medicaid programs, but waiting may have negative consequences as patients progress in their disease.

## Supreme Court temporarily blocks Purdue Pharma bankruptcy plan
The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a bankruptcy plan for Purdue Pharma that would reconstitute the company under a new name while shielding the Sackler family from liability claims related to the opioid crisis. A bankruptcy court judge initially approved the plan, but a federal judge in New York blocked it, stating that bankruptcy laws do not allow liability shields for non-bankruptcy parties. An appellate court later reinstated the plan, leading the Department of Justice to seek intervention from the Supreme Court. Arguments will be heard in the next term starting in October.

## Ohio Vote on State Constitution Change Fails, Widens Abortion Debate
An effort to raise the threshold for changes to the Ohio state constitution failed by a 14-point margin. Critics linked the vote to an upcoming election question on abortion protections. Similar defeats have been seen in other states, including Kansas and Kentucky. Strategists argue that the proposal's wording may have hindered its success. Abortion is a significant issue that played a role in the 2022 midterms. Democrats expected a red wave but limited their losses and expanded their Senate majority. The anti-ballot initiative coalition's victory adds to Democrats' wins in increasing abortion access. The high turnout in the vote indicates the risk abortion poses to GOP's White House and Senate aspirations. Republicans believe messaging is crucial and support less strict abortion bans. Anti-abortion groups emphasize candidates' commitment on the issue. The defeat in Ohio is seen as a preview of the fall election's outcome on abortion protections in the state constitution.
