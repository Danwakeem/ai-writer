## 11-year-old girl charged with felony after false kidnapping report inspired by online challenge
An 11-year-old girl in Florida has been arrested and charged with a felony after falsely reporting her friend's kidnapping as part of an online challenge.

The girl admitted that she thought it would be funny, but Sheriff Mike Chitwood emphasized the dangerous consequences and wasted resources. Parents are urged to closely monitor their children's social media use.
