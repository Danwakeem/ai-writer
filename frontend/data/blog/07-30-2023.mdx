## Rent increases in the US remain modest despite overall rise
Median rent rose just 0.5% in June, year over year, after falling in May for the first time since the pandemic hit the U.S. Despite this, renters in cities such as Cincinnati and Indianapolis are still facing increases of 5% or more. The construction of new luxury apartments in select metro areas has contributed to rising rents, with median rent in the US now at $2,029. However, the increase in rental supply is concentrated in high job growth areas, leaving most tenants unlikely to see significant reductions in rent.
