## Train Derails in Ohio, But No Hazardous Materials Reported
A Norfolk Southern freight train derailed near the Clark County Fairgrounds in Springfield, Ohio, causing 20 cars out of the 212-car train to lose their tracks. Despite speculation, no hazardous materials were reported, and officials have not issued any evacuation orders.

## Minnesota grants voting rights to formerly incarcerated individuals
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed a law granting voting rights to those who have completed their time for their offenses and are living and working in their communities. The law requires Department of Corrections or judiciary system officials to provide written notice and an application to vote to newly released individuals. This follows a nationwide shift in voting policy aimed at enfranchising those convicted of felonies. 25 states in the US currently allow felons to vote, while over a million people convicted of felonies are still banned from voting in Florida, which leads the nation in felon disenfranchisement.

## New Drug May Be a Better Alternative to Statins for Reducing Heart Disease
Statins, the most commonly prescribed drugs for reducing the risk of heart disease, have side effects including muscle aches. A recent study found that a newer drug, called Nexletol, can reduce heart disease risks without the side effects of statins. The drug substantially lowers LDL cholesterol, and could be a safe and effective alternative for high-risk patients who cannot take statins. Experts are hailing the 23% drop in heart attacks among patients who took Nexletol, calling it a notable impact. However, patients should always check with their doctors before starting or stopping medication.

## Michigan judge dismisses lawsuits against school district over 2021 school shooting
All lawsuits filed against Oxford Community School District in connection with the 2021 school shooting at Oxford High have been dismissed by a Michigan Circuit Court judge. The judge ruled that the district and its employees have governmental immunity and cannot be sued as the shooter is the most direct cause of the attack. The victims and families of victims had filed nearly dozen lawsuits accusing the school district and several school employees of negligence, gross negligence and violation of the Child Protection Law, among other claims. Attorney Ven Johnson, who represents the families of students who were killed in the shooting, criticized the ruling and the law behind it, saying his clients feel victimized all over again.
