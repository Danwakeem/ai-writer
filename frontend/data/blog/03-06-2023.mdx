Li Keqiang, who was once seen as a potential top leader of China, has exited the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Li lacked visibility and was sidelined as Xi Jinping accumulated ever-greater powers. He was a cautious, capable, and highly intelligent bureaucrat in a consensus-oriented Communist Party that stifles dissent. Li's departure marks the end of an era in which expertise and performance, rather than political loyalty to Xi, was the primary career criterion for ambitious officials seeking to rise up to higher office.
