## Typo in U.S. military emails sends sensitive information to Mali domain
A recent typo in U.S. military emails resulted in sensitive information being sent to the domain used by the government of Mali. The Department of Defense has been aware of this issue since 2015. Some of the redirected emails contained sensitive Pentagon information, including diplomatic documents and travel itineraries. Steps have been taken to block outgoing emails to the incorrect domain, but the Defense Department is also coordinating with partners to address the unauthorized disclosure of information.

The family of a 4-year-old girl who was burned by a hot McDonald's nugget has been awarded $400,000 in damages for the past four years and another $400,000 for the future.
