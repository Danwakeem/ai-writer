## No Health and Safety Warnings Given Before Deadly New Zealand Volcano Eruption, Prosecutor Says
Tourists visiting New Zealand's White Island, also known as Whakaari, were not provided with any health and safety warnings before a volcanic eruption in 2019 that killed 22 people. The island's owners and tour operators are now on trial for allegedly failing to adequately protect tourists and staff. The prosecutor argued that while the eruption was not predictable, it was foreseeable, and tourists were not given the opportunity to make an informed decision about the risks involved. The trial is expected to last for 16 weeks.
