## Biden opens global democracy summit with focus on tech and corruption
The Biden administration opens its global democracy summit with a focus on making 'technology work for and not against democracy', having invited 120 global leaders. Along with key promises, such as supporting free and independent media, the administration has made a joint agreement with 10 other nations on guiding principles for how governments should use surveillance technology. Participating nations discussed various topics, including media freedom and youth roles in democratic systems. US Supreme Court’s decision in voting restrictions will be issued later this year.

## IAEA Director General crosses Ukraine war front lines in effort to safeguard nuclear plant
International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi is working on 'realistic measures' aimed at safeguarding the partially Russia-occupied nuclear plant located in Ukraine amidst intensifying combat, and avoiding a catastrophic accident. A deal was 'close,' according to Grossi, who has long called for a protection zone around the plant. Although Ukraine insists all Russian forces must leave the facility, Grossi is working on measures he believes will be acceptable to both sides.

## Biden and Netanyahu at odds over Israel's judicial changes
Tensions are escalating between the US and Israel over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposed judicial changes. President Biden publicly disagreed with the plan, urging compromise and saying Netanyahu's government 'cannot continue down this road'. The plan has been the subject of mass protest and businesses, top economists, and former security chiefs have all come out against it. It would give Netanyahu and his allies the final say in appointing judges and permit parliament, controlled by his allies, the ability to overturn Supreme Court decisions and limit the court’s ability to review laws.

## Former UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti returns to help bank execute deal with Credit Suisse
UBS has appointed former CEO Sergio Ermotti as its executive chairman to help manage the deal with Credit Suisse, which is the biggest single financial transaction since 2008. This $3.25 billion deal was arranged hastily to stem the upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two U.S. banks and the jitters about Credit Suisse’s long-running troubles. While UBS executives stated no immediate plan about job cuts linked to the deal, Swiss lawmakers and academics raised concerns that it could create an unwieldy Swiss banking behemoth.

## Russia Halts Information Exchanges with the U.S. Amid Missile Test Warnings Termination
Russia has suspended information exchanges and halted missile test warnings with the U.S. amidst the West's recent support for Ukraine, as Moscow flaunts its nuclear arsenal. The parties have been exchanging advance warnings on test launches for decades, but Russia's abrupt change of course was announced following the U.S. officials' statement that the countries have stopped sharing biannual nuclear weapons data. The New START treaty signed in 2010 set caps on nuclear weapons use, which Russia emphasized that it wasn't withdrawing from despite suspending its participation. Recently, President Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to its ally Belarus.

## Revise child marriage law: German court
The German government is required by a constitutional court to amend the existing law on marriages under the age of 18. The court declared marriages of individuals under the age of 16 in other countries null and void without examining them. However, it noted that couples who have reached adulthood could still choose to continue their marriage. The lawmakers are also instructed to consider making modifications in the law to provide for spousal support after a divorce. The government has until mid-2024 to make the necessary revisions.
