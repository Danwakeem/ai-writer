## Turkish Lira weakens by over 7% as Erdogan's unconventional economic policies persist
The Turkish lira has weakened by around 7% against the dollar and euro on Wednesday, bringing its loss to over 8% since Erdogan's new government assumed power. This is largely attributed to Erdogan's unconventional economic policies, such as keeping borrowing costs low despite inflationary pressures. However, the reappointment of Mehmet Simsek, a well-respected former banker, as treasury and finance minister offers hope for a return to more conventional economic policies.

## Philadelphia activist pleads guilty to federal charges of obstructing law enforcement
Anthony Smith pleaded guilty to a federal charge of obstructing law enforcement during a civil disorder after flipping over a police car parked outside City Hall during the protests following George Floyd’s death. Smith’s plea comes after Philadelphia officials announced a $9.25 million settlement over lawsuits filed by him and other activists challenging the police response to the protests and civil disorder. Smith's attorney said his client's bad judgement during that time was not a reflection of who he is as a person, as he has long been a positive force in the community. Other defendants who pleaded guilty to setting fire to cars during the demonstration were also sentenced to shorter terms. The settlement will be distributed among 343 plaintiffs in connection with police actions during the protests that erupted in West Philadelphia and along Interstate 676 in the city center.

## NYC files lawsuit against Hyundai and Kia over vehicle thefts
New York City has filed a lawsuit against Hyundai Motor America and Kia America Inc. after a surge in vehicle thefts. The lawsuit claims the carmakers failed to adopt immobilizer technology to prevent theft and that the thefts are negatively impacting public safety and emergency services. Hyundai says it is committed to ensuring the quality and integrity of its products and made engine immobilizers standard on all vehicles from November 2021, but a subset of entry-level models are still not equipped. Last month, Hyundai and Kia reached a settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit over vehicle thefts.
