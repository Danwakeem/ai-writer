## Former Lawyer Alex Murdaugh Appeals Convictions and Sentences for Murders of His Wife and Son
Alex Murdaugh's lawyers have filed a notice of appeal on his behalf for the convictions and sentences for the murders of his wife and son. The appeal was filed a week after Murdaugh was sentenced to life in prison. Murdaugh has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, claiming that he did not kill his family members. However, prosecutors presented evidence that contradicted his alibi and argued that the murders were a way to divert attention away from his years of theft and lies. The trial has highlighted the downfall of a once-powerful attorney from a prominent family in South Carolina.

## Job Market Accelerates in February Despite Rising Unemployment Rate
The US job market remains healthy with hiring accelerating during February, although unemployment rose to 3.6% from 3.4%, according to a government report. The report also revealed the majority of gains were made in the service industries from restaurants and hotels, but average wage growth slowed, suggesting a possible easing of inflationary pressures. While the data is positive, the high level of hiring in a strong job market could prompt the Federal Reserve to increase rate hikes to tame still-high inflation.

## Former Theranos executive Ramesh Balwani denied bail while appealing conviction
Former Theranos executive Ramesh Balwani, who was convicted last year of fraud and conspiracy, has been denied bail while appealing his 12-year prison sentence. He is due to report to an Atlanta federal prison on 15th March if his appeal to remain free is unsuccessful. Balwani's lawyers argue that he poses no danger to the community and assert that he would prevail in his appeal of the convictions. Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes is facing a similar situation as her lawyers are also pushing to allow her to stay out of prison during an appeal of her conviction on four felony counts of investor fraud and conspiracy.

## Sexual Assault Reports Increase at Military Academies Despite Prevention Programs
Reports of sexual assault at the Army, Navy, and Air Force academies increased by 18% during the 2022 school year, according to the Pentagon. While officials aren't sure if COVID-19-related restrictions phasing out contributed to the increase, a student survey found that all types of unwanted sexual contact increased at the schools due to alcohol use. The increase prompted outrage and legislation, but the numbers continue to climb despite prevention programs. The survey also found sophomore and junior men were most at risk for sexual assault, and women were more likely to report attacks than men.

## Iran and Saudi Arabia strike deal to restore diplomatic ties
China has brokered a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore diplomatic ties and reopen embassies within two months. This comes as a major diplomatic victory for China and is seen as a result of the US slowly withdrawing from the Middle East. Tensions have escalated since the US unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal in 2018, with Iran being blamed for some attacks which has further caused tensions in the region. The historical and religious differences between the two countries have contributed to strained relations. It is unclear what this will mean for the US and their involvement in the region.

## BP CEO's Pay Rises to $12M as Oil Prices Soar, Prompting Calls for Executive Tax
BP's CEO Bernard Looney's pay rose to £10m ($12m) in 2022, up from his previous £4.5m package; a boost that combined a £2.4m cash bonus and £6m in bonus company stock. The pay hike follows BP reporting its highest-ever annual earnings last month. Similarly, Shell's CEO was also given a substantial increase to his pay package. Activists and some opposition lawmakers are demanding that measures be taken to protect consumers from rising energy costs. Britain’s Liberal Democrat party has proposed a one-off “bonanza bonus” tax for energy company executives similar to the levy on bankers' bonuses imposed in 2009-10.
