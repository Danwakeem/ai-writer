## Sudanese military and paramilitary forces engage in deadly conflict
The ongoing war between the Sudanese military and a powerful paramilitary force has resulted in widespread violence, casualties, and displacement. The conflict began after months of tension between military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, escalated into open fighting. Over 3,000 people have been killed and more than 6,000 others wounded, with the actual death toll believed to be much higher. Millions of people have been displaced from their homes as a result. The capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas have become battlefields. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, has condemned the violence and called for respect of humanitarian and human rights law. The region of Darfur has experienced intense fighting, with reports of ethnic targeting and the situation resembling the past genocide in the early 2000s. The conflict has spread to other provinces including North Kordofan, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile.
