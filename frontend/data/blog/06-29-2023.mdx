## UK Court Rules Rwanda Not a Safe Third Country for Asylum Seekers
The UK Court of Appeals ruled that Rwanda cannot be considered a 'safe third country' for asylum seekers. While the court said that deporting asylum seekers to another safe country is not illegal, it determined that Rwanda had 'serious deficiencies' in its asylum system and that asylum seekers would face a risk of mistreatment if sent there. The UK government plans to challenge the ruling at the Supreme Court. Human rights groups argue that it is immoral and inhumane to send migrants thousands of miles away to a country with a poor human rights record. The government of Rwanda disputes the ruling, claiming to be one of the safest countries in the world.
