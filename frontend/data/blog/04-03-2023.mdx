## Man convicted of killing a prison guard denied by Supreme Court
The US Supreme Court rejected arguments to reconsider a death sentence for David Brown, who was convicted of killing a prison guard during a 1999 prison escape attempt. Brown claims he is entitled to a reconsideration because prosecutors failed to reveal evidence that might have changed his sentence. The evidence related to a confession from a fellow inmate, Barry Edge, that supported Brown's innocence in the killing. The US Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence and denied the appeal, stating that Edge's statement wasn't favorable to Brown.

## Philippines and US expand military presence to boost coastal defense amid tensions with China
The Philippines and US will add four military bases under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement fostering a stronger alliance to counter China's aggressive territorial expansion. While Philippine Navy Chief of Staff Adm. Adeluis Bordado claimed that the US' military presence would boost the country's disaster response capability, Chinese officials are infuriated by the two sites which would provide US forces with a staging ground close to southern China and Taiwan. Philippine President Marcos Jr.'s administration has filed over 77 diplomatic protests against China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters since he took office last year.

## Finland shifts to right in latest European election as NATO membership looms
The center-right National Coalition Party won the majority of votes in Finland's latest election, leaving the Social Democrats and Prime Minister Sanna Marin behind. This shift from left to right was marked by the victory of the anti-immigration populist group, The Finns, who got the best result in their history. Forming a government will be tricky for the National Coalition party given the country's bloated debt and NATO membership's requirement to increase defense spending. The Green League and the Left-Alliance, Marin's coalition partners, lost votes while The Finns, considered the election's biggest winners, share similar views with the National Coalition Party on developing Finland’s economy.

## Strong Earthquake Hits Papua New Guinea
A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 struck Papua New Guinea, damaging several buildings and homes near the quake's epicenter. There are no reports of serious injury or death as disaster relief workers are struggling to verify the extent of the damage due to the remoteness and swamps of the region. The earthquake was felt in surrounding regions and was relatively deep, which tends to create less damage on the surface. Papua New Guinea is located on the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, to the east of Indonesia and north of Australia.
