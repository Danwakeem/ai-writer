## Ukraine Strikes Russian Tanker in Black Sea in Retaliation
Ukraine's Security Service has claimed responsibility for a drone attack on a Russian tanker carrying fuel for Russian forces. The attack marks the second sea attack involving drones in a day, highlighting the Black Sea as an important battleground in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The incident resulted in no casualties among the crew, but the tanker suffered damage. The attack briefly halted traffic on the Kerch Bridge and ferry transport. Shipping expert Jayendu Krishna believes that these attacks may increase the risk of Russian attacks on Ukrainian ports rather than putting pressure on Russia to halt attacks and reinstate trade deals.

## Texas judge grants temporary injunction on multiple abortion laws
A Texas judge has granted a temporary injunction on Texas' abortion laws, which include bans on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The judge also denied the state's request to dismiss the lawsuit. The Center for Reproductive Rights, representing the women in the case, stated that the ruling provides clarity to doctors on when they can provide abortions based on their own medical judgment. The judge ruled that doctors cannot be prosecuted for exercising good faith judgment and that the plaintiffs should have been provided abortions. The judge also found the bans unconstitutional and cited uncertainty surrounding the bans' medical exceptions. The lawsuit alleges that the bans have denied necessary medical care to pregnant people due to fear of liability among physicians. Texas' abortion ban is a second-degree felony, punishable by up to life in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. This is the first lawsuit filed by women impacted by the abortion bans.
