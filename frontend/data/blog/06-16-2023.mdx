## Iowa Supreme Court blocks state’s six-week abortion ban from going into effect
The Iowa Supreme Court has prevented a 2018 law that prevents abortions from being performed once cardiac activity can be detected - commonly around six weeks of pregnancy - from going into effect. The court was split 3-3, and the law had been permanently struck down by a district court in January 2019. The bill had been signed into law by Iowa's Governor Kim Reynolds and would have made Iowa the latest state to pass a 'heartbeat' abortion ban if it had been upheld.

## Hundreds feared dead in Mediterranean trawler sinking
As many as 500 people are feared to have died after a trawler carrying 750 migrants from Libya to Italy reportedly capsized, prompting Greek authorities to extend the search and rescue operation. While 104 people have been rescued and 78 bodies recovered, hundreds more refugees and migrants are missing. The disaster has increased pressure on the Greek government and the European Union to address the issue of migration and prompted appeals for concerted action from Pope Francis and the United Nations.
