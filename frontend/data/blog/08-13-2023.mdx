## Heat alerts issued for one-third of Americans as extreme temperatures persist
Extreme heat continues to impact a large portion of the US, with heat alerts issued for over 115 million Americans across 16 states. Daily record-breaking temperatures are possible in more than 30 places, including Portland, Dallas, Houston, and locations in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. The South will experience a surging heat wave, but a cold front from the North will provide some relief. However, temperatures in the 90s and 100s will persist throughout the week, and the heat dome is expected to expand later this month.
