## Fetal mortality rates declined
A report by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics found that overall fetal mortality rates in 2021 remained unchanged compared to the previous year. However, among racial/ethnic groups, Black women saw a significant decline in mortality rates. The report did not explore reasons behind the decline for Black women, but experts suggest that increased attention to improving access and care may have played a role. Fetal mortality rates also varied by state, with Mississippi having the highest rates and New Mexico and Connecticut having the lowest. Smoking during pregnancy was associated with higher fetal mortality rates.
