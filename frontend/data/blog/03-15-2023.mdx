## Federal Judge in Texas Seeks to Withhold Information on Abortion Access Case
A federal judge in Amarillo, Texas, has requested to delay publicly disclosing details related to a hearing involving opponents of abortion access suing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on whether regulators had the right to approve the abortion medication mifepristone. The judge's request may limit public understanding of the case, and his efforts to lower the hearing's profile have backfired as organizers plan to stage protests outside the courthouse. If the plaintiffs win, sales of abortion medication will be halted nationwide.

## Russian fighter jet collides with US drone over Black Sea
A Russian fighter jet collided with the rear propeller of an unmanned MQ-9 Reaper drone over the Black Sea, prompting the United States to bring it down near Ukraine. Two Russian Su-27 jets were involved in the incident. The U.S. state department called it a "brazen violation of international law" and Ambassador Anatoly Antonov maintained that the Russian jets had not hit or fired on the drone.

## Bans on Books and Drag Performances Growing Across U.S., Advocates Warn
Bans on books and drag performances have increased across the U.S., and there have been concerns about those laws violating the First Amendment of free expression. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression has stated that Americans' speech rights are being restricted at all levels of government. However, censorship is not limited to any one political group. It appears to be widespread in many states, and it's deeply troubling. Recently, artworks that were shown in more than two dozen states were unexpectedly censored at Lewis-Clark State College focusing on wifedom and motherhood.

## Wholesale inflation slows, driven by lower egg and shipping costs
Wholesale inflation in the US slowed down by 0.1% between January and February, largely driven by a drop in egg prices. Service prices dropped by 0.1% due to lower shipping costs, while energy and food prices also fell. Excluding volatile sectors, there was no change in core wholesale prices. The producer price data is an early signal of future inflation rates, which are also shown to be rising in a consumer price report. Inflation fears have put added pressure on the Fed, which is considering the possibility of interest rate hikes to fight inflation. However, the recent failure of two major banks has complicated these decisions and some economists expect the central bank to halt rate hikes at their next meeting.

## Massive Seaweed Bloom Approaching Florida Could Damage Tourism Industry
A massive sargassum seaweed bloom, spanning over 5,000 miles and weighing over six million tons, is approaching Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, posing a threat to tourism in the area. Seaweed can pile up and produce a noxious gas. The bloom, which is not harmful to wildlife, is dependent on wind, temperature, and ocean currents. Sargassum is a type of brown seaweed that originates in the Atlantic Ocean. Researchers blame warmer waters and the increased use of fertilizers for its growth. Experts predict that coastal communities will have to manage this new normal.
