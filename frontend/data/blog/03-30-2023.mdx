## U.S. Jobless Claims Rise despite Fed efforts to cool Economy
The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose to 198,000 for the week ending March 25, up by 7,000 on the previous week, despite attempts by the Federal Reserve to cool the economy and the job market. The Fed hiked its key interest rate by a quarter-point last week to fight high inflation, while Chair Jerome Powell indicated that more banks reducing lending could slow the economy, hiring and inflation, thus suppressing prices. The Fed predicts that the unemployment rate will rise from its current 3.6% to 4.5% by year’s end.

## US economy slows down in Q4 2022 amid recession fears
The US economy grew at a slower pace than previously estimated in the Q4 2022, losing momentum as businesses reduced investments and consumer spending growth slowed down. Most of the growth in the quarter came from businesses restocking their inventories, not an indication of underlying economic strength. Economists anticipate a recession later this year as the Federal Reserve aims to tame inflation by raising interest rates. The finance conditions that led to recent bank collapses are likely to slow the economy even further.

## China Warns US Over Taiwan as Tensions Escalate
China warns US not to have official meetings with Taiwan, stating it will closely follow the situation and resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
