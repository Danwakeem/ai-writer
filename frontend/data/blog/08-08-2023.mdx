American diplomats, including Acting Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, traveled to Niger to meet with the coup leaders but were unable to achieve significant traction. The US has not officially declared a coup in Niger and has paused assistance, but funding could resume if constitutional order is restored.
