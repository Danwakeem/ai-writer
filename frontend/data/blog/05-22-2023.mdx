## India suffers deadly heat wave as temperatures skyrocket
The Indian Meteorological Department issued a heat wave alert for seven southern and central states last week and broadened it to the capital and some northern states on Monday as sizzling temperatures breached normal levels. The southwest monsoon is slightly delayed this year and will hit in the first week of June, causing temperatures to stay high longer than usual. The heat wave caused blackouts lasting more than 12 hours in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, and the lack of power has made life unbearable for many residents. A searing heat wave in April that struck parts of South Asia was made at least 30 times more likely by climate change. India is the third highest emitter of planet-warming gases, and drastic measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are the only solution.

Kyriakos Mitsotakis did not secure a governing majority in Greece's parliamentary election after his New Democracy party won 40.79% of the vote, leaving him five seats short of the threshold to govern alone. He is expected to secure the support needed in a second vote slated for late June or early July. Mitsotakis has promised to boost employment and wages, as well as cuts taxes if elected.
