## North Korea Conducts Missile Test Amidst U.S.-South Korea War Games and U.K.-Australia Security Pact Partnership
North Korea has conducted a missile test in response to the U.S.-South Korea war games and the U.K.-Australia security pact partnership. The recent missile test shows that North Korea is developing its submarine-based military power and could be dangerous. There are concerns about the transfer of nuclear weapons material and the potential nuclear proliferation in the wake of this security pact partnership. Although North Korea is years away from developing nuclear-powered submarines, they have been testing diesel-powered submarines that could carry missiles topped with nuclear warheads. While AUKUS submarines do not carry nuclear warheads, their nuclear power complicates the global nuclear proliferation debate.

## US Treasury and Justice Departments target Russian oligarchs
US government officials are focusing on the legal liquidation of Russian oligarchs' property, expanding financial penalties on those who facilitate sanctions evasion, and closing law loopholes, which allow oligarchs to use shell companies within the US financial system. The KleptoCapture task force headed by Andrew Adams, acting deputy assistant attorney general, is prioritizing efforts to identify those who violate sanctions and export controls. Additionally, efforts are being made to strengthen laws that serve as loopholes for sanctions evaders. The US has blocked or frozen over $58bn worth of sanctioned Russians' assets worldwide so far. The focus on oligarchs' wealth managers and associates has proved more effective than individual sanctions in a recent study, and the liquidation of oligarchs' yachts and other properties is being pursued, turning them into cash to benefit Ukraine.

## Iran pardons over 82,000 prisoners amid nationwide protests
Iran announced that over 82,000 prisoners and people facing charges have been pardoned following the country’s crackdown on protests that followed the death of Mahsa Amini in September last year. The announcement from Iran’s judiciary head suggests that the regime feels secure enough to admit the scale of the unrest, which represented the most serious challenge to the establishment since the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Among those who have been pardoned, over 22,000 were arrested in the protests. However, the pardon has not addressed the issue that many of those jailed have yet to be held accountable for their actions during the protests.

## U.K. to increase military spending amid concerns about Russia and China
The U.K. will increase military spending to 2.5% of its GDP in the longer term to deal with the challenges posed by Russia and China. Military chiefs wanted it to rise to 3%, but the additional funding would be used to replenish Britain's ammunition stocks and build nuclear-powered submarines with the U.S. and Australia. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, expressed a need for economic ties with China, but acknowledged the country's authoritarianism.
