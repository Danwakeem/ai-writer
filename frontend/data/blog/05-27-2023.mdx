## Oath Keeper extremist gets 4 years for role in Jan. 6 Capitol attack
Former militia leader, Jessica Watkins, has been sentenced to 41 months in prison for her role in the U.S. Capitol attack on January 6th, where she led a small group into the building, enabling many others to ultimately disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.

## Family of man fatally shot by Walgreens security guard files civil lawsuit seeking $25 million in damages
The parents of Banko Brown, a man who was fatally shot by a Walgreens security guard during an altercation in April, have filed a civil lawsuit seeking at least $25 million in damages. The lawsuit also names the security guard, Michael Earl-Wayne Anthony, and Kingdom Group Protective Services, which provides security for Walgreens and employs Anthony. Attorneys for Brown's family claim that the guard used deadly force during a minor theft situation and that Walgreens and Kingdom Group encouraged the use of force to detain suspected shoplifters. The San Francisco District Attorney’s Office declined to file criminal charges against Anthony citing insufficient evidence. California Attorney General Rob Bonta agreed to review the decision this week.

Democratic leaders say financing bills, including for the A's, may not go through if Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoes the five budget bills.
