## Kenyan Runner Wins Unprecedented Fifth Major Marathon at Historic Boston Race
Despite a headwind and thick fog, Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge won the Boston Marathon triumphantly, giving him victory in an unprecedented five out of the six major marathons. Alongside Kipchoge, Ethiopian Amane Beriso also emerged victorious in the women's division among the strongest field of runners in the half-century of division's history. The wheelchair divisions began, followed by waves of recreational runners. The 2021 race also included a nonbinary division, with 27 athletes registered. The Boston marathon pays great importance on strategic runs rather than fast times, and is significant to Boston, especially now as the 10-year anniversary of the devastating tragedy occurred. Instead of taking up the race independently, it is important to run it strategically.

## Former US Senator urges Northern Ireland's current leaders to act with courage and vision
Northern Ireland’s leaders must act with courage and vision as their predecessors did 25 years ago when bitter enemies forged an unlikely peace, says former U.S. Senator George Mitchell. The Good Friday Agreement created peace in Northern Ireland after years of conflict, but currently, politics is deadlocked putting peace at risk. The political impasse will be resolved by the DUP returning to the government, according to Sinn Fein’s Adams. Brexit shook the peace settlement and unsettled unionists, who view the economic barrier as undermining Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom. Violence hasn’t disappeared completely as IRA dissidents shot and wounded a senior police officer who opposes the peace process.
