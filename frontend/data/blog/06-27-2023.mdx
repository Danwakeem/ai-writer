## House Speaker considers impeachment inquiry into Attorney General over handling of Hunter Biden investigation
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is considering launching an impeachment inquiry against Attorney General Merrick Garland over allegations he mishandled the investigation into President Joe Biden's son, according to a tweet. McCarthy wants to question David Weiss, a U.S. Attorney appointed by former President Donald Trump, about the investigation. McCarthy referred to a deadline Republicans set for Weiss to answer the Judiciary Committee's questions in July before initiating an impeachment inquiry. One of the whistleblowers, Gary Shapley, alleged that Weiss requested special counsel status which Garland denied. Hunter Biden has agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanors for failing to pay federal income tax in 2017 and 2018.

## Florida governor asks federal court to dismiss Disney's lawsuit
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has requested a federal court to dismiss Disney's lawsuit. DeSantis' lawyers argue that he and the secretary of Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity are 'immune' from the lawsuit, and add that DeSantis 'is entitled to legislative immunity.' The lawsuit originated from a disagreement between Disney and DeSantis over the 'Don't Say Gay' law passed in Florida that critics claim limits what students can learn about LGBTQ-related issues. Disney has accused DeSantis of retaliating against it for publicly criticizing the legislation.

## Malaria cases detected in the US, first time since 2003
Health officials have identified five cases of malaria, all of which were caught locally in the United States. Four of the cases occurred in Florida, with the fifth in Texas. Malaria is typically diagnosed only in people who contracted the disease abroad, with the last locally contracted cases appearing in 2003. The cases pose a low risk to the public at this time, however, with climate change potentially expanding the habitat for mosquitoes - which carry the disease - there is potential for the disease to further spread.
