## New 3D model of Titanic wreckage is largest ever undertaken
Using remote operated submersibles, a team of researchers spent six weeks last summer mapping the entire shipwreck and surrounding debris field. They collected 715,000 images, resulting in a one-to-one digital twin of the Titanic in every detail. The new 3D model captures both the bow and stern section, separated after sinking, including the propeller serial number. The model will help researchers work out the details of how the Titanic sank and allow people to walk through the ship themselves.
