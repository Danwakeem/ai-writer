## More gay and bisexual men eligible to donate blood following FDA guidelines
The American Red Cross announced that it will adopt the recent guidelines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), allowing more gay and bisexual men to donate blood. The FDA has changed its policies over the years, relaxing previous bans and rules. Under the new guidelines, men in monogamous relationships with other men can donate blood, and individuals of any gender or sexual orientation who have had multiple sexual partners and engaged in anal sex in the last three months will be asked to wait three months before donating. This change is seen as progress towards an inclusive blood donation process. The policy is based on scientific evidence and aligns with similar policies in Canada and the United Kingdom.
