## American Hotelier Sentenced in Rwanda has Sentence Commuted
A US resident and Belgian citizen, who was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison by the Rwandan government in September 2020 for supporting a rebel group, is set to be released after his presidential clemency appeal was granted. Paul Rusesabagina, who was depicted in the movie Hotel Rwanda, was accused of supporting the armed wing of his opposition political platform, the Rwandan Movement for Democratic Change; a charge he denied adamantly. Rusesabagina’s family have thanked the US government for their support in securing his release.

## Russian missile strikes kill 5 in Ukraine as conflict intensifies
Ukrainian officials reported the deaths of five people after Russian forces attacked with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles on an aid station in Kostiantynivka recently. The war-torn area had established hundreds of “points of invincibility” as a refuge for war-pressed residents. The conflict has grown increasingly violent recently, as Russian forces have used gliding bombs, missiles, and exploding drones to attack Ukraine. The warming weather has led Ukrainian forces to gear up for a counteroffensive, and new US-supplied tanks and other weapons are expected to join the fight. Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev has warned that Russia would use its atomic arsenal if Ukraine ever attempts to reclaim Crimea. He went on to say that Western experts operating weapons like the U.S.-made Patriot air defense missile systems supplied to Ukraine could be targeted. Russia is believed to want to create a safe zone around Russian-held areas in Ukraine.

## Utah bans social media use for children between 10:30pm and 6:30am and allows child lawsuits
Utah lawmakers have signed two laws targeting social media platforms. They prohibit the use of social media by children under 18 between 10:30pm and 6:30am and ask for age verification for those wanting to use these companies' services. The laws could open the door for lawsuits on behalf of children citing harm from such platforms. The issues covered by the Utah legislation have gained traction in other states too. Concerns including user privacy, hate speech, and the mental health impact on underage users have prompted dozens of states to advance similar proposals.
