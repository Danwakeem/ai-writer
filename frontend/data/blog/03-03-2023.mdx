## Activists Sentenced to Prison for Defying Oppressive Regime in Belarus
Ales Bialiatski and three of his colleagues, human rights defenders in Belarus, have been sentenced to prison for eight to nine years after being held behind bars for 21 months, despite maintaining their innocence. The harsh punishment came in response to massive protests over a 2020 election that many believe was rigged. Belarus stands out in their public support of Russia regarding the Ukrainian invasion, with other countries in the region not backing Moscow. This verdict has elicited outrage in the West, with many condemning the oppressive regime in Belarus.

## Tennessee restricts adult cabaret performances and drag shows in latest legislation
Tennessee has signed off on legislation which restricts adult cabaret performances and drag shows, making them misdemeanors for first-time offenders and Class E felonies for repeat violations. This is not the only instance of legislation cracking down on drag shows across America, due to an increase in backlash against drag performers and trans individuals. While sponsors of the bill argue that it protects families from unwanted displays of sexuality, opponents argue it is an attempt at discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community.

## Man's conviction overturned due to rap video evidence violating California's 'Decriminalizing Artistic Expression Act'
A man's conviction for first-degree murder and attempted murder has been overturned after it was ruled that the use of a rap video as evidence violated California's 'Decriminalizing Artistic Expression Act'. Prosecutors alleged that the video was linked to the crimes but the Court ruled that it was lacking in evidence of personal involvement. 'The conviction was overturned because the appellate court could see that there was very little evidence against Venable other than the video,' said the accused's attorney.

## Whistleblower of Pentagon Papers Daniel Ellsberg Diagnosed With Pancreatic Cancer
Daniel Ellsberg, the whistleblower of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War, has been diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer. The doctors told him he has three to six months to live. Ellsberg has opted not to undergo chemotherapy and will accept hospice care when needed. He provided the Pentagon Papers to Neil Sheehan, a reporter who broke the story for The New York Times in June 1971. Sheehan smuggled the documents out of the Massachusetts apartment where Ellsberg had stashed them, and the administration of President Richard Nixon got a court injunction arguing national security was at stake and publication was stopped. Despite the attempts to discredit him, Ellsberg feels grateful for his life and the impact he made on shortening the war.

The company claims it has made changes and improved ethics, but will still pay a significant fine.
