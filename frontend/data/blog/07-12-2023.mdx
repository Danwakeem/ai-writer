## Consumer prices rise 3%, signaling a slowdown in inflation
Consumer prices increased by 3% in June compared to a year ago, showing a significant cooldown in inflation. The reading exceeded economists' expectations but still remains above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 4.8%. Food prices continued to accelerate, with flour prices rising 12% and bakery products rising 9.5%. However, egg prices fell by 8% due to last year's avian flu outbreak. The Federal Reserve is set to discuss whether to raise interest rates in the coming weeks.

## San Francisco Faces Retail Exodus as Stores Close Down
The closure of numerous retail stores in San Francisco, including Whole Foods, Old Navy, and Nordstrom, has led to a decline in foot traffic and sluggish sales. Factors contributing to this trend include concerns over safety, the shift towards online shopping, and the impacts of the pandemic. While crime rates have affected the perception of safety in the city, San Francisco's chief economist notes that in-person sales have shown some improvement. Business advocates suggest that a recovery strategy should focus on safety measures, reducing apartment rents, and attracting visitors with parks and other attractions.
