## Man Dressed as Woman Robs Texas Banks with Sticky Notes
A man dressed as a woman, known as the 'Sticky Note Bandit,' has robbed three Texas banks by handing tellers sticky notes with threatening messages. Despite the disguise, the suspect has not been captured or identified. The FBI described the suspect as a 5-foot-8-inch Black man who used a black wig, sunglasses, a medical mask, a women's style sweater, ballet flats, and a black purse during the robberies. Two of the banks were robbed successfully, while the third robbery failed when a teller locked themselves in a back room.
