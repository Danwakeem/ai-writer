## Sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines partially reconstructed; reports suggest Ukrainian-owned yacht used
German investigators have reportedly reconstructed how the pipelines from Russia to Germany were sabotaged and reports suggest that a group of Ukrainians used a yacht to carry out the attack. The Ukrainian government has denied involvement and warned against drawing hasty conclusions. Investigations remain active, with no reliable information available to make any conclusions on the subject of state control. Gasunie does not expect the sabotaged Nord Stream pipelines to resume service any time soon and has written off its investment in the project.

## Tesla hit by probe into steering wheel bolts in Model Ys
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the loss of steering wheels in two Tesla Model Y SUVs that, according to two customer complaints, had been delivered with bolts to hold the wheels missing. Although the 120,000 estimated affected vehicles are from the 2023 model year, the low-mileage incidents occurred within a week of purchase this winter and caused no injuries. Detached steering wheels are rare in the auto industry, but not unprecedented. In February, Nissan recalled about 1,000 Ariya electric vehicles because the wheels could come off of the steering column due to a loose bolt.

## Controversial Pregnancy Drug Makena to be Withdrawn from Market
Covis Pharma has announced that it will withdraw the drug Makena, which was designed to help prevent premature births. The FDA had already been moving to get the drug off the market after Makena failed to show a benefit in helping mothers carry pregnancies to term. The injectable drug has become a symbol for the challenges the FDA faces to withdraw a medication when the manufacturer won’t do so voluntarily, and Covis has repeatedly appealed for more time to conduct additional research. The decision follows a public meeting at which outside advisers overwhelmingly concluded that Makena hasn’t been shown to work and should have its approval revoked. The FDA granted Makena accelerated approval in 2011 based on a small study in women with a history of early deliveries.

## UK and Sweden Affected by Heavy Snowfall as Arctic Air Sweeps Across Europe
The Scottish Highlands recorded the coldest March temperatures since 2010, as freezing Arctic air is expected to cause travel disruptions and power cuts across the UK. Bristol Airport and dozens of schools across Wales have closed, with heavy snowfall also affecting travel in Sweden. The UK is likely to experience further sleet, snow and freezing temperatures until Friday. The cold snap is caused by the clash of an Arctic maritime air mass with milder Atlantic air. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute has issued a yellow warning for difficult weather on Wednesday.

## Toxic fumes sicken thousands of Iranian schoolgirls
Thousands of mostly girls' schools in Iran have reported being sickened by toxic fumes, and Iranian officials are investigating. No one has claimed responsibility, and no fatalities have been reported. The crisis has raised concerns about the safety of schools in Iran and the government's response to the poisonings, as the authorities have arrested journalists, activists, and others for discussing the issue. Some Iranian officials have suggested that the poisonings and protests are part of a foreign conspiracy aimed at fomenting unrest. But given that the clerical rulers in Iran have never objected to girls' education, this seems unlikely. UNESCO has urged thorough investigations and immediate actions, and the World Health Organization has documented similar phenomena in other countries, suggesting that it may be a mass psychogenic illness.
