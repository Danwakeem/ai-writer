## Montana law targeting drag performers temporarily blocked by federal judge
A federal judge has granted a temporary restraining order blocking a new law in Montana that bans minors from attending drag performances and restricts such events in public places. The judge found that the law is likely to harm individuals who do not conform to traditional gender and identity norms, including transgender people. The law does not provide clear definitions for terms used, leading to self-censorship out of fear of prosecution. The temporary restraining order allows Montana Pride to advertise and hold events in public places. The case will continue to be heard in court.

## Tesla to Open Showroom on Tribal Land to Circumvent State Laws
Tesla is expanding its efforts to open showrooms and sales centers on tribal lands, allowing the company to bypass state laws that prevent manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. A showroom and sales center will open this fall at the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut, owned by the Mohegan Tribe. This move follows the announcement of another showroom opening on land owned by the Oneida Indian Nation in New York. Tesla has faced opposition from car dealerships and has been denied dealership licenses in several states. However, it has found success in states that allow direct-to-consumer sales. The company previously partnered with Native American tribes to establish facilities on sovereign land.

## Government funding fight continues as shutdown looms
As the August recess begins, the government funding fight remains unresolved. The House has only passed one of the 12 appropriation bills, while the Senate has not passed any. In September, lawmakers will have limited time to fund the government before the September 30 deadline. Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces the challenge of uniting his fractured conference on spending, with some members pushing for deeper spending cuts. There is a possibility of a partial government shutdown, with Republicans and Democrats blaming each other for the impasse. House and Senate leaders will need to work together to avoid a shutdown.
