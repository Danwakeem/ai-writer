## JPMorgan Chase reaches settlement with Jeffrey Epstein's victims
JPMorgan Chase has settled a lawsuit filed by victims of Jeffrey Epstein, who accused the bank of being Epstein’s financial conduit that allowed him to continue operating a sex trafficking operation. Both lawsuits were filed after New York state in November enacted a temporary law letting adult victims of sexual abuse to sue others for the abuse they suffered, even if the abuse occurred long ago. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.

This comes as a big boost to UNESCO’s World Heritage program and projects to fight climate change and teach girls to read. The US government plans to pay its 2023 dues plus $10 million in bonus contributions this year. The decision is expected to face approval from UNESCO’s member states in the coming weeks.
