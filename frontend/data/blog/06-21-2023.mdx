## Israeli settlers set fire to Palestinian homes amid rising tensions and violence in the West Bank

## China accuses Biden of violating diplomatic protocol with spy balloon remarks
China has accused U.S. President Joe Biden of violating diplomatic protocol with his recent remarks regarding the suspected Chinese spy balloon shot down by the U.S. Air Force over the East Coast. While both sides saw U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent visit to Beijing as productive and aimed at easing tensions, China continues to refuse talks between their militaries. Although the countries have deep economic and cultural links, they profoundly disagree on many issues.

Cleary, left school, ending the college's Title IX investigation. Despite being tracked via technology, Cleary remains at large, with investigators believing he is likely overseas and on the move. Keeler and her lawyers are questioning how he has been able to avoid capture and if he has assumed a false identity or if someone is helping him.

## Yusef Salaam, Once Wrongfully Convicted in ‘Central Park Five’ Case, Seeks Harlem Political Seat
Yusef Salaam, one of the Central Park Five, is running in a competitive June 27 Democratic primary to represent a Harlem district. The group was wrongly accused, convicted, and imprisoned for the rape and beating of a white woman jogging in Central Park in 1989. They spent between five and 12 years in prison before DNA evidence linked another man to the attack and their convictions were vacated in 2002. Salaam has no political track record but believes his personal experiences with injustice make him qualified. Despite endorsements from influential figures, opponents argue he does not know enough about local government to handle crises within the district.
