## Embattled Rep. George Santos set to appear in court for status conference hearing
Embattled Rep. George Santos is scheduled to appear in court for a status conference hearing in front of U.S. District Judge Joanna Seybert on Long Island. Last week, it was revealed that Santos' father and aunt guaranteed his $500,000 bond. Santos objected to the names being unsealed, citing fear of harassment. Additionally, Santos is facing accusations of fraud and his case has prompted an expanded probe into allegations of unemployment insurance fraud.

## Prosecutors urge appeals court to uphold charges against Ghislaine Maxwell
Prosecutors argue that Ghislaine Maxwell, the former associate of Jeffrey Epstein, facilitated and participated in the sexual abuse of multiple young girls. Maxwell claims she was only prosecuted as a proxy for Epstein and argues that she was inoculated by a 2007 non-prosecution agreement. Defense attorneys argue that the government breached its promise not to prosecute Maxwell and joined forces with civil attorneys to develop new allegations. The defense also appeals based on a juror's omission on a pre-trial questionnaire. Prosecutors argue that the judge was right to conclude the juror was able to be fair and impartial.
