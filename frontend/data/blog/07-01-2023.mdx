## FBI director deposed in legal cases involving former agents
FBI director Chris Wray was deposed under oath in legal cases brought by former agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The deposition may lead to Trump's sworn deposition in the future. Both Strzok and Page filed separate lawsuits accusing the Justice Department and FBI of misconduct. Strzok claims wrongful termination, while Page alleges privacy violations. A judge ruled that any deposition of Trump would be limited to two hours.

## 5G Rollout Near Airports Raises Concerns of Flight Disruptions
Wireless providers are set to power up new 5G systems near major airports, posing potential disruptions to flights. Aviation groups have expressed concerns about interference with aircraft equipment, particularly devices that use radio waves for low visibility landings. While major US airlines have upgraded their height-measuring devices to protect against 5G interference, Delta and JetBlue have a number of planes that have not been retrofitted. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously postponed the rollout, but the postponement ends on Saturday. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg warned that flights could be disrupted if planes are not retrofitted, and airlines anticipate potential delays and cancellations.

## Supreme Court ruling on student loan payments could impact economic growth
The Supreme Court's ruling to resume student loan payments could have a modest impact on economic growth, according to economists. While the total funds diverted to loan payments will amount to a small percentage of GDP, some economists believe it could be enough to trigger a recession. Others predict that the resumption of payments will put a strain on household budgets and delay economic recovery. The decision has sparked debates, with proponents arguing for student debt relief as a racial and economic justice issue, while opponents express concerns about inflation and fiscal responsibility.

## State Department report criticizes decisions made during U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan
The State Department released a declassified version of its long-anticipated report examining the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The report finds that the decisions made by both President Trump and President Biden posed significant challenges for the State Department, hindered diplomatic efforts, and affected support to the Afghan government and people. It highlights shortcomings in planning, organization, and decision-making, including the speed of the military withdrawal and handing over Bagram Air Base. The report also notes that officials failed to act urgently and relied too much on assurances from Afghanistan's then-president. The release does not mention a July 2021 message from diplomats in Kabul warning of a potential collapse in Afghanistan. Republicans are urging the State Department to share more of the report's findings.

## Ticks Use Static Charges to Jump on to Hosts, Study Finds
A study has found that ticks use static charges to propel themselves onto hosts to feed. Despite the small distances involved, the charges allow ticks to effectively jump three or four flights of stairs. Ticks are ambush predators that wait for a passing host before grabbing on and biting. The research discovered that static charges enable ticks to reach hosts that don't make direct contact with them. The findings could lead to new methods to reduce tick-related diseases.
