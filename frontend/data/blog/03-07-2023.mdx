A 25-year-old hiker, identified as Henry Minh Hoang from California, fell about 20 feet to the shoreline below after slipping beyond a safety fence in an area of the Cape Kiwanda State Natural Area known as 'the punch bowl'. Witnesses lost sight of Hoang after he was knocked unconscious from the fall and was swept into the ocean by the waves. His body was eventually found, and authorities had to suspend their search until the following morning due to dangerous conditions. Cape Kiwanda State Natural Area’s website mentions the hazards of the fragile sandstone cliffs, which can crumble without warning.

## Are 2024 Paris Olympics tickets really accessible or affordable? Fans disagree
Despite the new ticket draw registration for the upcoming 2024 Olympics in Paris, some fans are complaining about the lack of transparency and affordable options. Some have described the buying system as a 'shambles' and have criticized the mandatory buying of the same number of tickets in each sport within a pack.

## Iranian Activists and Journalists Facing Criminal Charges over Suspected Poisonings
Iranian prosecutors are filing charges against activists, journalists, and others over their comments on the recent incidents of suspected poisoning that have been plaguing the country. This has coincided with the ongoing struggle faced by the Iranian government due to months of country-wide protest over the death of Mahsa Amini. Over 127 schools have reported suspected cases of poisoning so far and anxiety among parents is climbing. The extent of the casualties is unclear, with estimates ranging from several hundred to five thousand. At least one government lawmaker has claimed that these attacks may be the work of religious fundamentalists seeking to undermine the education of young girls. Some 100 journalists have been arrested since the start of September for their reporting on the crisis. The United Nations has recently been called upon to investigate these cases by the US press secretary, among others, who are still attempting to determine whether or not they are part of a larger coordinated effort or a case of mass hysteria.
