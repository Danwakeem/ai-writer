## Job Openings Drop to 9.6 Million in June, Signaling Slowing Job Market
Job openings in the US decreased to 9.6 million in June, down from 10.3 million in April and the lowest in over two years. Furthermore, the number of people quitting their jobs also fell sharply, indicating a slowing job market. The Federal Reserve hopes that this slowdown will ease pressure on businesses to raise wages and help lower inflation. Despite the decline, there are still 1.6 jobs available for every unemployed worker. Economists predict that the July jobs report will show a gain of 200,000 jobs with an unchanged unemployment rate. Job openings have soared since the pandemic, reaching a record high of 12 million in March 2022. Average paychecks have also risen, increasing by 4.6% in the April-June quarter compared to a year earlier, but the Fed worries that without increased productivity, such wage growth could lead to higher inflation.
