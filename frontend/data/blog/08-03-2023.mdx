## Biden calls for release of Niger's president and preservation of democracy
U.S. President Joe Biden has released a statement expressing concern over the apparent coup in Niger and calling for the release of President Mohamed Bazoum. He emphasizes the importance of democracy and peaceful assembly in the partnership between the United States and Niger. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), African Union, and United Nations have all condemned the coup and imposed sanctions. Nearby nations, including Guinea, Burkina Faso, and Mali, have expressed support for the junta. The U.S. government is actively engaged in resolving the situation, while the U.S. Department of State has issued a travel advisory and reduced personnel in Niger. The military takeover also poses a threat to the U.S.-Niger counterterrorism mission in the region. Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, has shown support for the coup, but its fighters have not arrived in Niger as of now. The situation is being closely monitored for any further developments.

## Four workers wounded in second round of shelling at Ukrainian cathedral
Four workers from Ukraine's emergency service were injured in a second round of shelling at St. Catherine's Cathedral. This attack follows a missile strike last week that damaged the cathedral. The ongoing fighting in Ukraine poses a risk to the country's cultural monuments, including the cathedral, which is one of the city's most notable buildings. The Ukrainian president's office reported two deaths in Russian attacks, and the Ukrainian air force successfully shot down 15 drones launched by Russia in the Kyiv region. Additionally, Ukraine's military has been launching attack drones into Russia, with several being shot down. Kherson, where the cathedral is located, was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in November 2021 after nearly nine months of Russian occupation. It has since become the front line in the country's south and is targeted by daily Russian attacks. The city was further affected by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in early June, which led to flooding and evacuations.
