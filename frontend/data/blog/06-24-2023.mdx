## Report Finds Intelligence Community Split on Covid-19 Origins
A declassified U.S. intelligence report found that agencies are still divided on the origin of COVID-19, with four agencies believing the virus was transmitted from animals, and two agencies suspecting a lab leak in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Republicans and some researchers accused the U.S. government of withholding classified information, and critics argued that the report was incomplete.

## GOP lawmakers continue to press probe into Hunter Biden’s business dealings
The Justice Department's investigation into Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings has entered its fifth year and Republican lawmakers are still pressing to uncover wrongdoing. New whistleblower allegations have emerged in the form of a WhatsApp message allegedly sent by Hunter Biden bragging about his ability to wield political influence. The White House has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated, but the plea deal between Hunter Biden and federal prosecutors has only further fuelled the ongoing investigation. Republicans are calling it a sweetheart deal, and some have criticised the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney who brokered it. Meanwhile, Attorney General Garland has defended the integrity of the Justice Department.

## Woman sentenced to 18 years for role in husband's murder during Zambia hunting trip
Lori Milliron has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for her part in the murder of Bianca Rudolph. Milliron was convicted of perjury, being an accessory to murder after the fact, and obstructing a grand jury in a case that involved her partner, US dentist Lawrence Rudolph. Rudolph was convicted last year of fatally shooting his wife while on a hunting trip in Zambia. Prosecutors argued that evidence showed that Bianca could not have accidentally killed herself, as initially claimed by her husband.

## Teenage access to guns fuels rise in deadly shootings
Recent mass shootings involving teens are on the rise in the US due to availability of guns. Teenage access to guns and the use of firearms in disagreements has replaced physical aggression as the norm. Guns enable them to act recklessly and impulsively, often without thinking of the consequences. Although programs are increasingly available for young people, homicides by teenagers have risen 90% for those aged 15 to 17, with firearms playing a significant role. Social media can also be a catalyst for violence, with quarrels escalating from cyberspace to reality. Homicide is now the top cause of death for young African Americans.
