## American Diplomatic Convoy Attacked in Sudan Amid Widespread Clashes Between Rival Generals
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed that an American diplomatic convoy fired upon in Sudan, where rival generals are fighting. The Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have agreed to a 24-hour cease-fire. The fighting began in Khartoum, resulting in significant civilian deaths and injuries. The two generals were allies behind the 2021 military coup that dissolved Sudan's power-sharing government. The fighting caught practically all of the UN's operations and humanitarian aid in the crossfire.

## Three Americans go missing while sailing from Mexico to San Diego
Kerry and Frank O'Brien, a married couple, hired a mechanic, Larry Gross to sail from Mazatl√°n to San Diego. However, the lack of GPS tracking and poor cellular service near the Baja peninsula has left the families of the missing Americans uncertain about their loved ones' whereabouts. The US and Mexican authorities believe that the team likely encountered 'significant' weather and waves, and the group's planned 10-day journey was potentially unrealistic. The Coast Guard is working on plotting where their life raft might have drifted under the current weather conditions.
