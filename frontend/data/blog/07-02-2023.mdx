## Flight delays decrease despite concerns about 5G
Flight delays and cancellations decreased from earlier in the week, with at least 850 cancellations and over 28,000 delays recorded on Saturday. The cancellation rate was about 1% in the US. Concerns about 5G interference with aircraft equipment did not materialize, although Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg warned of possible disruptions. Most major airlines have made the necessary changes to adapt to 5G, except for Delta. The FAA and wireless carriers reached a compromise to limit 5G signals near busy airports. Buttigieg warned that delays and cancellations could increase for planes without retrofitted altimeters.

## North Carolina reduces abortion limit to 12 weeks
North Carolina has passed a law banning abortions after 12 weeks, despite ongoing legal challenges. The ban, which went into effect on Saturday, has been partially blocked by a temporary restraining order. Certain provisions, such as requiring sexual assault survivors to obtain an abortion in a hospital after 12 weeks, will not be enforced until October 1. The new law also requires abortion providers to give a state-mandated script about the risks of abortion 72 hours before the appointment. North Carolina has become an important access point for women in the South seeking abortions.

## Bureau of Land Management cancels plan to spray neurotoxin pesticide in New Mexico
The Bureau of Land Management has decided not to disperse 670 gallons of a potent neurotoxin pesticide in a New Mexico county due to concerns about its impact on bees, monarch butterflies, and other vital insects. The plan was aimed at addressing a severe outbreak of grasshoppers that posed a threat to grazing cattle and the ecosystem. Environmental groups criticized the pesticide, highlighting its potential harm to the environment and humans.

A lawsuit has been filed against the Franklin County Juvenile Detention Center in Benton, citing inhumane conditions and deprivation of rights. The facility allegedly denies access to education, has black mold on the walls, and lacks mental health professionals.

Solitary confinement, which can be extremely harmful and retraumatizing, has been banned for youth held by the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice. The law will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2024.
