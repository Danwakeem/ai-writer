## Fed Likely to Resume Interest Rate Hikes as Economy Shows Strength
The latest evidence of economic strength makes it all but certain that the Fed will resume its interest rate hikes later this month. Despite the smallest increase in hiring in 2 1/2 years, the job market remains durable with historically high number of job openings and a low unemployment rate. Average work week length and wage growth have also increased, indicating strong customer demand and faster pay gains. The report provides some evidence of slower hiring, which may reassure the Fed that the economy is moderating. Overall, the economy continues to expand and demand for workers remains high.
