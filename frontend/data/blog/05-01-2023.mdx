## US-Israel tensions seen as Kevin McCarthy addresses Knesset
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's address to the Knesset highlights the tense ties between the Biden White House and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, which includes ultranationalists once at the fringes of Israeli politics. Netanyahu's Republican leanings, seen through his speech to Congress against the Iran nuclear deal, have tested ties with American Jews who mostly lean Democrat. Critics say the legal overhaul of Israel's judiciary system will upend the country's system of checks and balances and endanger the country’s democratic foundations.

## Violence continues in Sudan as aid groups struggle to provide assistance
The conflict in Sudan has caused violence and forced many civilians to flee. Aid groups have struggled to provide aid and medical care due to a lack of supplies and the looting of aid supplies. Hospitals in areas with active fighting are out of service, and more than 400 civilians have been killed with over 2,000 wounded. Although an aircraft carrying medical aid has landed to resupply hospitals in Khartoum and other hot spots, more aid is needed. Many foreign nationals have been evacuated, and the healthcare system is near collapse. Multiple aid agencies have had to suspend operations and evacuate their employees due to the situation. The United States and Britain are assisting in evacuating their citizens from the country.
