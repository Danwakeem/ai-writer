## Federal Judge Blocks Tennessee Drag Performance Law
A federal judge in Tennessee has halted the implementation of the state's law restricting public drag performances, citing redundancy as a reason for the ruling. The law would make any adult cabaret performance on public property, or anywhere it can be viewed by minors a criminal offense. The Shelby County District Attorney didn't object to the temporary restraining order.

## Pope Francis holds Palm Sunday Mass after recent hospitalization
Pope Francis celebrated Palm Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square just days after being released from the hospital. Despite hoarseness in his voice, the pope read a 15-minute-long homily, which focused on various forms of pain, love, and rejection. Francis also spoke about the abandonment many feel, referencing a homeless man who recently died under the colonnade circling St. Peter's Square. The pope then conducted a procession, greeting the cardinals one by one, and waving to the faithful. This event opened a heavy schedule for Holy Week appointments.

## Tragic incident: Two killed and one injured in hot air balloon crash near Teotihuacan, Mexico
Two people have been killed and a child injured after a hot air balloon crashed near the pre-Hispanic ruin site of Teotihuacan, just north of Mexico City.

## Protests in Israel Against Plan to Weaken Supreme Court
Protesters in Tel Aviv and other towns demonstrated against the Israeli government's plans to weaken the Supreme Court by giving Netanyahu and his allies the final say in appointing the nation's judges and limiting the court's ability to review laws. The plan has plunged Israel into a domestic crisis, with business leaders, economists and security chiefs warning against autocracy. Fighter pilots and reservists have threatened not to work, and the country's currency has declined in value. While Netanyahu has delayed the plan, protest organizers vow to keep up the pressure to scrap it.

## ICC Seeks Arrest of Putin on War Crimes Charges Amid Tensions
The International Criminal Court decision to seek Russian president Vladimir Putin's arrest is driven by the conflicting relationship between justice and peace. Judges in The Hague found Putin and his commissioner for children's rights responsible for war crimes – specifically the unlawful deportation and unlawful transfer of children from occupied Ukraine areas to Russia. Other world leaders have faced justice in international courts, such as Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague after losing power. Although Putin sitting in court may seem unlikely, some analysts suspect the hanging warrant on Putin could provide an incentive to prolong the fighting. Hungary has criticised the warrants, stating they lead towards escalation and not peace.
