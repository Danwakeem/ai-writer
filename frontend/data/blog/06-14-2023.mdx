Lilia Chanysheva, former head of Navalny's office in Bashkortostan, has been sentenced to prison and fined for calling for extremism and violating rights, following a ruling designating Navalny's foundation and regional offices as extremist organizations. Navalny himself is facing new extremism charges that could result in decades-long imprisonment. The Kremlin's crackdown on opposition and government critics has intensified. In a separate case, a man who threw gasoline bombs at police vans in Moscow last year was sentenced to six years in prison.

Lori Pinkham has spoken out in an interview with ABC's “Good Morning America” after Matthew Nilo pleaded not guilty to several charges, including three counts of aggravated rape, two counts of kidnapping, one count of assault with intent to rape and one count of indecent assault and battery.

## EU says Google must sell part of its business to satisfy antitrust concerns
The European Union has demanded that Google sell a part of its business to satisfy concerns about its dominance and antitrust violations. The move is the first time the bloc has told a tech giant to separate key aspects of its operations. Google can contest the ruling, which followed a formal investigation that opened in June 2021. The European Commission’s decision comes after previous fines worth billions of euros were imposed on Google for antitrust violations. Google disagrees with the decision and said it will make a case in its defence.
