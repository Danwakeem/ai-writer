## Pope Francis and Italian Government Call for More Births to Reverse Demographic Trend
Pope Francis and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni called for more resources and measures to be dedicated towards increasing the country's birth rate in order to prevent the economy from collapsing as the population continues to decline. Italy recorded a record low number of live births last year, which combined with an elevated number of deaths, has accelerated the demographic trend that threatens the country’s social security system. The Italian government is backing a campaign to encourage at least 500,000 births annually by 2033. Meanwhile, opposition figures point to reducing precarious work contracts and improving access to subsidized day care centers to support women, as key measures to tackle the issue.
