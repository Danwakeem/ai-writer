## Russian central bank to hold emergency meeting amid plummeting ruble
Russia's central bank will review its key interest rate in an emergency meeting following the significant decline of the ruble against the dollar. The weakening of the ruble is attributed to increased defense spending, falling exports, and a shift towards a war economy. The central bank aims to stabilize the situation and reduce volatility by halting the purchase of foreign currency. Concerns over rising prices and a decrease in standard of living have been expressed by some Russians, while others hope for stabilization.
