## French President Emmanuel Macron's legacy contested amid pension reform standoff
French President Emmanuel Macron is encountering opposition to his efforts to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.

His public displays of displeasure may weigh heavily on his future decisions, and while he might enact the higher retirement age, it could end his ability to pass future legislation. Two no-confidence motions have been filed against Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne by Macron's political adversaries, although France's strong presidential powers suggest that Macron would retain substantial powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense.
