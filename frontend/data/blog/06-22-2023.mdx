## NTSB starts sworn testimony in probe of Ohio train derailment
The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting a two-day investigative hearing on the derailment of a Norfolk Southern Railway train carrying toxic chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio. Witnesses, who will testify under oath, include representatives of Norfolk Southern, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Ohio National Guard, and local fire and police departments. Topics of focus include communications and preparedness for the initial emergency response, the decision to vent and burn vinyl chloride tank cars, and freight car bearing failure modes and wayside detection systems, among others. No fatalities or injuries were reported in the incident, but Ohio residents filed a class-action lawsuit against Norfolk Southern.

## US jobless claims rise, possibly signaling Federal Reserve rate hikes are impacting labor market
The number of jobless claims in the US remains relatively high, according to Labor Department figures released on Thursday. The latest claims figures were the same as the previous week, with a four-week moving average rise of 8,500 to 255,750, the highest since November 2021. There are also indications that the recent rise in benefit applications could point to a notable cooling of the labor market, echoing warnings from Federal Reserve officials. Despite the elevated figures the US economy has created over 20 million jobs since the pandemic began. Further rate hikes are planned by the year-end, though their impact on inflation may be slower than expected.

## House censures Rep. Schiff over past comments, directs Ethics Committee investigation
The House passed a censure resolution against Rep. Schiff, censuring him over comments he made years ago during investigations into former President Donald Trump and directing the House Ethics Committee to investigate his actions. Democrats were critical of the move, calling it a 'disgrace', while Republicans painted the measure as a 'clear vote between right and wrong.' Schiff was surrounded by fellow Democrats in the chamber, many of whom high-fived and embraced him as he walked towards the well. The House has only censured two other members in the 21st century.
