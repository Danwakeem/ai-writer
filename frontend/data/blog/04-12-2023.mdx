## Florida prepares for 100th execution as 'ninja killer' set to die
Louis Bernard Gaskin, who was dubbed 'ninja killer' for wearing all-black ninja clothing, is scheduled to be executed in Florida for the 1989 murder of Robert and Georgette Sturmfels. He was also convicted of armed robbery, burglary, and attempted murder, and confessed to the crimes before his trial. Florida law currently requires a unanimous jury vote for capital punishment, but a bill may be passed allowing 8-4 jury recommendations. This will be the 100th execution since the reinstatement of the death penalty, with 297 still on death row.

## Trapped climbers in Nepal's Khumbu Icefall, one of the most treacherous sections of Mount Everest
Two climbers became trapped in a crevasse of Mount Everest's Khumbu Icefall, a dangerous section of the climb, as they made their way to the mountain's first camp. Rescue teams are searching on foot for the two climbers as a rescue helicopter attempts to locate them. The Khumbu Icefall is known for its constantly shifting glaciers, deep crevasses, and overhanging ice as big as 10-story buildings. The area was the location of one of the deadliest disasters in Everest climbing history in 2014 when an avalanche of ice killed 16 Sherpa guides. Hundreds of foreign climbers and Nepalese guides are currently attempting to scale the mountain during the main climbing season, which ends at the end of May.

## MLB Teams Extend Alcohol Sales As Shorter Games Mean Shorter Drinking Time
At least four MLB teams have extended their alcohol sales through the eighth inning due to shorter MLB games, thanks to the new pitch clock and other rules. Some minor league teams have seen no drop in concession sales despite shorter games. Teams already had areas around ballparks where fans could get alcohol after the seventh inning. MLB says it does not regulate when teams sell alcohol, but many teams cut off sales in the seventh inning to avoid overserving customers who drive home after the game.
