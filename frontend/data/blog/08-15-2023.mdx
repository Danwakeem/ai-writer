## Retail sales rise in July, boosted by online and department store spending
Retail sales in July increased by 0.7% from June, exceeding expectations and following a gain of 0.3% the previous month. The rise was attributed to strong spending during Amazon Prime Day and a solid increase in online sales. Department stores, clothing and accessories stores, sporting goods stores, and hobby stores reported gains, while furniture, electronics, and motor vehicle and parts dealers experienced declines. The report reflects the economy's resilience despite challenging economic conditions and higher interest rates. Inflation in July edged up after 12 months of declines, with core inflation remaining low. Big retailer earnings and the end of a student loan moratorium later this year may affect spending habits in the latter half of the year. Home Depot reported better-than-expected second-quarter results but maintained its sales decline forecast for the year. Lowe's began offering holiday merchandise earlier than last year due to increased online searches for holiday items.

Gerald Ridsdale, a former Catholic priest, has been sentenced to an additional year in prison for indecently assaulting a 13-year-old boy in 1987. This is Ridsdale's 193rd conviction for child abuse. He has been in prison since 1994 and will likely die in custody. Ridsdale's frequent relocations were found to be evidence of the church covering up his crimes. Cardinal George Pell, who knew about Ridsdale's abuse, denied any previous knowledge of the allegations.

## Montana youths win climate case, court declares state's fossil fuel-promoting laws unconstitutional
A group of young people from Montana successfully argued that the state failed to protect their right to a clean environment by continuing to use fossil fuels. The court ruled that a provision preventing consideration of climate impacts in the state's energy projects is unconstitutional. The judge's order highlighted the scientific evidence on global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions and the adverse impacts of climate change on young people's well-being. The decision is based on the Montana Constitution, and similar challenges are underway in other states. Montana officials will now be required to consider greenhouse gas emissions when making decisions on energy permitting.
