## Consumer Prices Rose 4% Last Month
Consumer prices rose 4% last month compared to a year ago, dropping more than expected and bolstering hopes that inflation will return to normal levels. The latest reading, however, is still double the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2%. The cooling of prices suggests the Federal Reserve has gained further traction in its effort to decelerate economic growth and slash prices while averting a recession. The inflation data on Tuesday will mark the final contribution of evidence to Federal Reserve deliberations that will culminate with a rate decision on Wednesday.

Officials in Miami are anticipating the possibility of pro-Trump protesters gathering in the city for former President Donald Trump's court hearing.
