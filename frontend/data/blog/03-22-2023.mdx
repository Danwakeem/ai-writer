## North Korea Fires Cruise Missiles During U.S.-South Korea Joint Military Exercise
North Korea fired several cruise missiles toward the East Sea during the U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise. The drills included large-scale landing exercises for the Amphibious Assault Ship USS Makin Island, which had just arrived in South Korea. This was in response to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister's vow to take overwhelming actions to the joint military exercise. The North Korean regime is showcasing its weapons' combat readiness, as Park Wongon, a professor of North Korean Studies, says. These cruise missiles, although not considered as threatening as ballistic missiles, cannot be overlooked in the region because of their difficulty to detect and intercept when flying at a low altitude.

## Slovakia to buy $1B worth attack choppers from the US
Slovakia will buy Bell AH-1Z attack choppers, 500 AGM-114 Hellfire II missiles and training for $1 billion, with $340 million coming from Slovakia and the remaining $660 million to be covered by US foreign military financing. 200 million euros in additional compensation will be given to Slovakia by the EU.

## Retired soldiers and policemen clash with riot police and troops in Lebanon
Retired soldiers and depositors clashed with riot police and troops in Beirut, Lebanon. The demonstrators were protesting for better pay and the ability to access their savings after local banks imposed informal capital controls. The country has been burdened with harsh economic conditions because of years of mismanagement by the ruling class. The Lebanese pound has lost more than 95% of its value over the past three years, causing significant hardship for the population, and businesses have resorted to dollarization. The international community has asked Lebanon to implement reforms, but the political class has resisted, leaving three-quarters of the population in poverty and causing inflation to soar.

## Consumer Prices Rise Faster Than Expected in UK Inflation Report
UK inflation rose to 10.4% in the past 12 months according to the Office for National Statistics, surprising analysts who had predicted a slowdown to 9.9%. The increase puts upward pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates again, despite concerns about how it may impact an increasingly strained global banking system. The report signifies the challenges faced by UK consumers as food, drinks, clothing and energy costs continue to increase, leading to an overall living standards decline. However, government subsidies should begin to impact the high cost of energy, slowing inflation later in the year, according to economists.

## Israeli airstrike damages Aleppo airport and arms depot in Syria
Israeli warplanes have bombed Aleppo airport in Syria, causing damage to the runway and putting the facility out of service, Syria's civil aviation head, Bassem Mansour, has said. Repair work has begun, but the airport has been a vital channel for aid following the recent earthquake in the region. In addition to the airport, the attack also destroyed an arms depot for Iran-backed militants, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Israel has carried out hundreds of similar strikes on targets inside Syria over the past few years.

## International backlash as Israel revokes law dismantling four settlements in West Bank
Jordan's parliament has approved the expulsion of Israel's envoy and the US have summoned Israel's ambassador after the country's Knesset voted to revoke a 2005 law, which dismantled four settlements. Critics argue that this could allow rebuilding and threaten Palestinian hopes for statehood. Pressure builds against Israel's new hardline government as protesters demonstrated against plans to overhaul the legal system. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected criticism, stating it ends discrimination against Jews living in “northern Samaria”.
