## Coinbase faces securities charges from SEC
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a lawsuit against Coinbase for operating as an unregistered exchange and violating US securities laws. The SEC claims that Coinbase did not give investors lawful protections while acting as a broker and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and other equitable relief. Coinbase responded saying the SEC hasn't been transparent in how it regulates cryptocurrencies and that the solution is legislation that allows fair rules for the road to be developed transparently and applied equally. The SEC had warned Coinbase in March that it could face securities charges and had long signaled that Coinbase had been flouting securities laws.

## World Bank predicts slower global economic growth in 2023
The World Bank forecasts that the global economy will only expand by 2.1% in 2023, lower than the previous estimate of 1.7%, although better than the current growth rate of 3.1% in 2022. The bank's prediction attributes the sluggish growth to last year's sharp and synchronized slowdown, persisting this year into a sharp downturn. Additionally, one-third of developing countries will not meet their per-capita income level from 2019 by the end of next year. Meanwhile, the bank revised its US economic growth forecast to 1.1% this year, and foresees a marked slowdown in global trade this year. It also predicts a sharp drop in energy and commodity prices for this year and next.

## NYPD's revamped 'stop-and-frisk' tactics criticized by monitor
A monitor overseeing the NYPD's Neighborhood Safety Teams has found fault with their stop-and-frisk tactic, stating that officers appear to be stopping, frisking, and searching individuals at an unsatisfactory level of compliance. The vast majority of stops, about 97%, that occurred between 2003 and 2022 happened during Bloomberg's time as mayor, while NYPD stops conducted last year under Mayor Adams' administration amounted to over 15,000. The monitor urges the NYPD to address the unconstitutional stops through improved training and supervision.

## US officials accuse China of aggression while holding private diplomatic talks
Although the US has accused China's military of aggression, high-level US officials recently held private talks in Beijing. The US seeks to maintain open lines of communication, and President Biden has made it clear that they don't seek any new Cold War. However, China's reticence to participate in military-to-military communication with the US remains, especially regarding the Taiwan issue. Despite this, Beijing has shown renewed enthusiasm for diplomacy, particularly in the US-China trade relationship, and officials from both countries hope to reschedule Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Beijing this summer. Still, a gap in military communication between the nations could lead to dangerous escalation and misunderstandings.
