## Los Angeles Support Staff Strike for Better Pay and Working Conditions, Demand Higher Staffing
Support staff in Los Angeles, represented by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), have gone on strike to demand better wages and increased staffing. Despite the steady rain before dawn, the workers joined picket lines to demand respect and demonstrate that they have some of the most critical responsibilities in schools. Rep. Adam Schiff said these strikers were earning "poverty wages." The union noted that district support staffers, on average, earn $25,000 per year, and many of them live in poverty because of low pay or limited work hours. They are asking for a 30% raise, while teachers want a 20% pay hike over two years.

## Stunning rebound in US existing home sales
Sales of existing homes in America smashed their predictions and registered the largest annual gain in two years as the market finally began to recover from a year-long slump. While lower mortgage rates were the key driver, some commentators have suggested that the increased sales activity is indicative of stronger economic conditions which will enable US house prices to continue to rise through 2019. Market watchers will look towards next month's data to see if this trend continues.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating an estimated 238,000 Honda Civics from the 2022 and 2023 model years. The investigation was launched after 145 complaints about increased steering effort causing an overreaction or inability to avoid a road hazard were received over the past 11 months, with most complaints coming from low-mile vehicles at highway speeds. Despite the complaints, there are no reported crashes or injuries from the problem. NHTSA will determine the scope and severity of the issue, and a recall may be possible.

## Tennessee advances abortion bill despite opposition from anti-abortion group
A bill in Tennessee that would have allowed doctors to provide abortions based on their judgment was opposed by influential anti-abortion lobbying group Tennessee Right to Life. The bill was subsequently reworked to allow doctors to use only 'reasonable medical judgment' when abortion is necessary to save the mother or prevent irreversible injury. The final vote passed with only two members of the Republican party opposing. The bill must now pass through the Senate and heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Bill Lee. The law still does not include exceptions for rape and incest.

## US to send older Abrams tanks to Ukraine as it battles Russia
The US plans to send older M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine instead of the newer M1A2 version as a part of a decision to help Ukrainian forces learn to use the equipment and maintain it in their fight against Russia's invasion. However, it's unclear how soon the US would begin training Ukrainian forces on how to use, maintain and repair the tanks, and any delivery of the tanks would not likely happen in the spring months. This is a part of a broader political strategy that opened the door for Germany to announce it would send its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and allow Poland and other allies to do the same.
