## Crypto executive Sam Bankman-Fried faces new bribery charge in addition to the 12 he already faces
Crypto executive Sam Bankman-Fried is now facing an additional criminal charge of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions. The new charge alleges that Bankman-Fried agreed to pay $40 million in cryptocurrency to foreign officials in China so they would unfreeze certain trading accounts on two of China's largest crypto exchanges that belonged to Alameda. The alleged bribery payment was carried out in November 2021, at which time the accounts were unfrozen, prosecutors said. Bankman-Fried has been free on a $250 million personal recognizance bond and under court orders to live with his parents.

## Honda recalls over 330,000 vehicles due to mode-related crash risk
Honda is recalling a total of over 330,000 vehicles that includes the Odyssey, Passport, Pilot, and Ridgeline models, because the heating pads behind both side-view mirrors may not be cemented properly, which can increase the risk of crash due to falling mirror glass. The recall is because the vehicles fail to meet the necessary rear visibility requirements. Honda is offering free replacement of side-view mirrors on affected vehicles and has announced that they will send owner notification letters starting May 8.

## New Moon discovery reveals potential new water reservoir
Glass beads found in lunar dirt brought back by the Chang'e 5 mission contain tiny amounts of water that could potentially be mined for use on the Moon's surface. The beads are produced by meteorite impacts and exist in immense quantities, but extracting enough water would be challenging. Water could be extracted by heating the beads, which could then be used by future lunar missions or to produce rocket fuel. This discovery reveals a potential new water reservoir on the Moon's surface.
