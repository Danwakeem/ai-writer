## Students at Sarah Huckabee Sanders' Alma Mater Stage Walkout to Protest Her Education Agenda
Little Rock Central High School students staged a walkout to protest the Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders' legislative agenda -- the LEARNS Act. The bill calls for universal teacher raises, universal pre-K, and a universal school voucher system phased in within three years. The legislation also bans classroom instruction on gender identity, sexual orientation, and sexual reproduction before fifth grade and teaching that would indoctrinate students with ideologies, such as Critical Race Theory. Students assert that Sanders' school policies will usher in a new era of segregation and suppress free expression of personality. The students are organizing a protest at the state Capitol next week to symbolically deliver an open letter signed by more than 1,300 people to Sanders.

Oklahoma is set to vote on legalising recreational marijuana which could see sales increase by $1.8bn by 2028, thanks, in part, to an influx of Texans drawn to the state by its mobile medical marijuana programme. Its low barriers to entry for growers, processors and dispensary operators, however, has overly saturated the market meaning many industry professionals are calling for improved legislation to incentivise further buyers into the industry. There are reportedly thousands of Texas tourists who Texas, Oklahoma believed to be a marijuana approved destination since it has one of the most liberal medical marijuana programmes in the country.
