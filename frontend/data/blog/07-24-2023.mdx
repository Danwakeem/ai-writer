## U.N. chief calls for action on Ukraine-Russia grain deal collapse
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged the international community to find solutions to the collapse of the Ukraine-Russia grain deal, warning that the most vulnerable will suffer. Russia and Ukraine have historically accounted for a significant portion of global wheat, barley, maize, and sunflower oil exports. Guterres called on Russia to return to the implementation of the Black Sea Initiative and emphasized the importance of unimpeded access to global markets for food products and fertilizer. The collapse of the deal has disrupted humanitarian food aid shipments to countries on the brink of famine, and has also raised concerns about the impact of climate change on food production. The Rome summit aims to assess progress and setbacks since the first food systems summit in 2021.
