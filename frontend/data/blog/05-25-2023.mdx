## Man who put feet up on Pelosi's desk during Capitol riot sentenced to prison
Richard 'Bigo' Barnett was sentenced to prison for his involvement in the 2021 attack on the US Capitol, including obstruction of an official proceeding and civil disorder. Despite claiming support for law enforcement, he insisted that peaceful protesters were attacked by police. The court noted his lack of remorse and active participation in the riot. Barnett had become famous for the images showing him with his feet up on Speaker Pelosi's desk, and had profited from online fundraisers and attempts to sell signed photos. Pelosi's staff were reported to be 'psychologically traumatized' by the riot.

## Indiana doctor to face disciplinary action for alleged violation of child abuse reporting and patient privacy laws
Dr. Caitlin Bernard is accused of violating Indiana state law by not reporting a girl's child abuse to authorities and breaking federal patient privacy laws by disclosing information to a newspaper reporter. Bernard's license could face disciplinary action from the state's Medical Licensing Board, which has the power to reprimand, revoke, or suspend a doctor's license. The case sparked controversy last summer, with some news outlets and Republican politicians falsely suggesting that Bernard fabricated the story until a 27-year-old man was charged with the rape in Columbus, Ohio.
