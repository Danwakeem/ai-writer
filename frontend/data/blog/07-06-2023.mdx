## US jobless claims rise but remain at healthy levels
U.S. applications for jobless benefits rose by 12,000 to 248,000 last week, but still indicate a strong job market. The four-week moving average of claims fell by 3,500 to 253,250, showing stability. Analysts expect the June jobs report to reveal an addition of about 205,000 jobs. The U.S. economy has shown resilience against the Federal Reserve's rate hikes, and the government's recent estimate of 2% economic growth in Q1 may result in more rate hikes. Layoffs in various sectors have been occurring, partly due to the impact of higher interest rates.

## Shell CEO refuses to rule out moving company's headquarters
Shell CEO Wael Sawan stated in an interview that the energy system still heavily relies on oil and gas, and until the development of renewable energy systems is at the required pace, it would be dangerous to cut out oil and gas production. This conflicts with climate scientists and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' recommendations for the fossil fuel industry to transition to renewable energy. Sawan also criticized the U.K. government's tax and energy policies, and while he has no immediate plans to move Shell's headquarters from London, he did not rule out the possibility for the future.
