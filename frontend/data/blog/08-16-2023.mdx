## UK inflation rate drops to lowest level since Russia's invasion
The Office for National Statistics reported that the UK's annual inflation rate fell to 6.8% in July, the lowest level since February 2022. The decline was primarily driven by lower energy prices and easing food price inflation following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Despite the decrease, the UK still has the highest inflation rate among G-7 nations. The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates next month, as wages are increasing at a record high.

## Rudy Giuliani, renowned for using RICO as prosecutor, faces RICO charges
Rudy Giuliani, once a successful prosecutor who utilized the RICO statute to charge mobsters, is now facing criminal RICO charges himself in Georgia. This irony is not lost on legal experts. Giuliani has been charged with aiding former President Trump in a conspiracy to change the election outcome. The indictment has been met with strong denial from Giuliani, who claims it is an attack on democracy. As a prosecutor, Giuliani used RICO to target organized crime families in New York City, which earned him a reputation as the godfather of the statute. However, his claims of being the first to use RICO have been disputed in the past.
