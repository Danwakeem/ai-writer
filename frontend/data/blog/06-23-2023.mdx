## Planned Parenthood, Emily’s List, NARAL throw support behind Biden, highlighting importance of abortion issue
Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Emily’s List and NARAL Pro-Choice America are endorsing President Biden’s reelection campaign to highlight the importance of the abortion issue for Democrats. Biden has pledged to work to protect reproductive health care, including enshrining abortion rights in federal law. Getting out early and loudly behind Biden and Harris is important on an issue that will animate voters, say the three organizations. In the lead-up to the midterm elections, the issue was among the top concerns for voters who rejected efforts to restrict abortion rights. Black women are more than three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women.
