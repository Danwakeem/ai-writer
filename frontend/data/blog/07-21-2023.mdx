## Grassley Releases Unverified Claim about Biden Family and Ukrainian Oligarch
Sen. Chuck Grassley released a confidential FBI informant's unverified claim that the Biden family was paid $10 million by a Ukrainian oligarch. Grassley defended his move as an act of transparency, while Democrats criticized him for selectively highlighting uncorroborated information. The FBI expressed concerns about the release, stating that it could risk the safety of a confidential source. The FD-1023 document cites an unnamed source who alleges that Joe and Hunter Biden received money from the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma. However, this claim has been debunked by various international leaders who criticized the former Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma. Grassley, who has criticized the release of raw intelligence in the past, faced criticism for releasing this unverified report. The FBI clarified that FD-1023 forms do not reflect the conclusions of investigators and should not be taken as validation or credibility. The investigation into these claims was closed by the Justice Department in 2020. Grassley called on the Justice Department and FBI to show their work.

## US soldier who fled to North Korea still missing
US Army soldier Joseph King is still missing after sprinting across the border into North Korea. Efforts to gather information about his whereabouts have been hindered by North Korea's lack of response. The US government has expressed concern for King's safety, given North Korea's treatment of previous American detainees. Communication between the two countries has deteriorated under the Biden administration, and there is limited contact between them. Experts believe North Korea may be using the situation as leverage, and may seek direct contact with an American official. However, the Biden administration is unlikely to prioritize securing King's release as he fled while facing disciplinary action. North Korea may choose to release him if they perceive it to be in their best interest.
