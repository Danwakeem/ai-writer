## Biden frames presidency as a referendum on competence and governance
As President Biden seeks a second term, he is again trying to frame the race as a referendum on competence and governance. His allies say his approach reflects his broader view of the presidency: tuning out the daily chatter and focusing on making a prolonged impact. Biden drew a red line in negotiations that the debt limit had to be extended until after the 2024 presidential election. The White House sees the recent bipartisan agreement as a success but Biden still faces criticism from some in his own party.

## North Korea’s first military spy satellite launch fails as rocket crashes; Kim’s sister accuses UN Council of being 'discriminative and rude'
North Korea's first attempt to launch a military spy satellite into orbit failed last week as the rocket crashed.
