## Trump lawyers seek new trial or damages reduction in E. Jean Carroll case
Former President Donald Trump's lawyers are seeking to challenge the $5 million damage award in the E. Jean Carroll case. The defense argues that the award is grossly excessive as the jury did not find that Trump raped her but held him liable for a lesser form of battery, sexual assault. Trump has already signaled he intends to appeal the verdict as his legal team argues that the number of views on social media stating that Carroll made a false accusation were unreliable and the arguments made by Trump's defense team are 'frivolous.'

## UAE restores corals threatened by habitat loss and warming seas
The Environment Agency Abu Dhabi has restored bleached and damaged corals by growing them in clear waters with strong currents and the right amount of sunlight in a nursery. Despite progress, the corals' survival is threatened by high oil tanker traffic, fossil-fuel related activities, offshore installations, and the exploitation of marine resources. The UAE has pledged to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050. A development company in Dubai aims to grow 1 billion artificial corals over a 200-square-kilometer area and 100 million mangrove trees on an 80-kilometer strip of beaches. However, experts stress the need to address the threat of overheating seas caused by climate change, otherwise coral bleaching events will continue to occur.
