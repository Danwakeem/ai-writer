## IOC meeting on Olympic athletes neutrality offers limited clarity
The Association of Summer Olympic International Federations met to discuss how certain Russian and Belarusian athletes, who have not actively supported the war in Ukraine and are not contracted to military or national security agencies, could potentially compete as neutral athletes in the 2024 Paris Olympics, but no progress was made in defining the criteria or establishing an independent panel to run evaluations. ASOIF officials have cautioned that each sport has different realities, including where Olympic qualification events are being hosted and the influence of Ukraine’s allies in sports and governments. IOC can still choose to bar Russia from its Olympics.

## Germany to close consulates in Russia following expulsion of diplomats
Germany will be closing its consulates in Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk and Kaliningrad by November, following Russia’s decision to reduce the number of German government officials allowed to stay in Russia. This move will leave only the embassy in Moscow and the consulate in St. Petersburg open for the Germans. However, Russia will still be allowed to operate the embassy in Berlin and one consulate after the end of the year. The move reflects the recent fall in relations between the two countries.

## Poland's Auschwitz museum criticizes ruling party's use of death camp footage in political ad
Poland's state-run Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum criticized the country's ruling Law and Justice party for using footage of the former death camp in a political ad. The party's ad referenced a tweet from journalist Tomasz Lis that controversially called for President Andrzej Duda and ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski to go to prison. Critics fear that a new law signed by Duda that is viewed as anti-democratic will be misused ahead of elections later this year. Tens of thousands are expected to join an anti-government march on Sunday in Warsaw.
