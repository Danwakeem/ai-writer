Pope Francis is recovering well after a three-hour surgery on Wednesday to treat increasingly painful scarring that was a result of previous abdominal surgeries and to repair a hernia in his abdominal wall.

A Syrian refugee with permanent Swedish residency attacked a playground in Annecy, injuring several children and adults. Witnesses reported that the suspect mentioned his daughter, his wife and Jesus Christ during the attack. The motive is unclear, but it does not appear to be terrorism-related.

## Judge rules FTX customer names to remain secret, citing trade secret protection
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey has ruled that the identities of FTX's individual creditors and institutional customers will still be protected from disclosure. Dorsey rejected arguments that customers' names should be made public for the benefit of the media and public, citing trade secrets protection as the primary reason.

## Illinois enacts pro-LGBTQ+ laws
Illinois has enacted two new laws to reinforce LGBTQ+ rights. One law will update existing acts to become more gender inclusive for LGBTQ+ youth in foster care, and the other will make it easier for LGBTQ+ couples to marry. These laws will come into effect on Aug. 8 and Jan. 1, 2024, respectively. The move follows more than 75 anti-LGBTQ+ bills that have been signed into law in the US this year, and warnings from Human Rights Campaign and NAACP about discriminatory laws and policies.

## American, JetBlue want to keep ticket sales, frequent-flyer programs in Northeast despite antitrust ruling
American Airlines and JetBlue are requesting to continue selling tickets on each other's flights and linking their frequent-flyer programs, despite losing an antitrust case over their partnership in the Northeast. The Justice Department wants the airlines to end most parts of the deal immediately and wind down sharing gates and takeoff and landing slots at key airports while honouring existing tickets to avoid hurting travellers. The airlines object to being barred from revenue-sharing or coordinating routes with each other for 10 years, and any other U.S. airline for two years.
