## Gunfire injures six in South Carolina after senior skip day turns violent.
A planned senior-skip-day party descended into chaos as five teenagers were injured along with an older beachgoer following two fights around 5:20 pm Friday afternoon. Despite law enforcement having numerous suspects in custody, they have so far not detained the shooter, nor can they say if the weapons recovered on the beach were related  with the incident. The celebrations ended in tragedy as hundreds of beachgoers scampered off amid screaming and police sirens.

## Federal Judge Halts FDA Approval of Mifepristone in Controversial Ruling
A federal judge has ruled to suspend the FDA's approval of mifepristone, a medication used in about half of all medication abortions in the U.S. The ruling has been suspended for seven days to allow the federal government to appeal. The manufacturer of generic mifepristone, GenBioPro, has said they will continue to make the product available. A Washington State judge has also issued an injunction preventing the FDA from changing the availability of mifepristone. If upheld, the Texas ruling may be expedited to the Supreme Court. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists condemned the decision, calling it a "grievous legal overstep". Vice President Kamala Harris called it a "dangerous precedent".

## Leaked US Secret Documents on Ukraine, Iran's Nuclear Program, North Korea's Missile Program Circulate on Social Media
Numerous secret U.S. documents including those about Ukraine continue to leak onto social media since early March, including those involving Iran's nuclear program, North Korea's missile program, China and other regions of the world. The leak is suspected to have been done deliberately to damage the Ukraine, the U.S., and NATO's efforts, and the documents contain limited intelligence value as they show just a snapshot in time from five weeks ago and Russian altered information. The Department of Defense has referred the matter to the Department of Justice for investigation, and Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed that the department is investigating the leak.

## Taliban orders Afghan women can't work for U.N. mission, threatens sanctions
The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UN spokesman Stephane Duarric have both slammed the latest Taliban order banning Afghan women from working for the U.N. mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), calling it unacceptable and a violation of fundamental rights. Female staff are essential for the U.N. to deliver life-saving assistance to the Afghan population. Taliban's move isolates Afghan women further and poses a problem for the Taliban, which relies on UN support. Mariam Maroof Arvin, an activist, believes Taliban is using the ban as a tool for leverage from the international community.
