## Unemployment Claims Rise, But U.S. Job Market Remains Strong
Despite a rise in unemployment claims, which is a proxy for layoffs, the United States job market is still strong. Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, and unemployment was at 3.5% in the same month. The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate nine times in just over a year since the tight job market is believed to put upward pressure on wages and overall prices; this is despite the rate of inflation edging lower, but remaining well above the Fed's 2% target. Economists believe that the United States may enter a recession later this year, while the Fed is hoping for a 'soft landing', lowering growth enough to bring inflation under control without causing a recession.

## Exhaustive search fails to locate missing sailors from California
Three Americans have disappeared since 4 April while sailing from Mazatlán to San Diego in a 41-foot sailboat. The Coast Guard has failed to locate Kerry O'Brien, Frank O'Brien and Harry Gross, despite help from the Mexican Navy and Coast Guard.

There is no onboard GPS tracking or satellite navigation, leaving family members of the missing sailors uncertain where they are.

## Man to be executed in Singapore for drug trafficking despite calls for clemency
Tangaraju Suppiah, a man detained for drug consumption and failure to report for a drug test, will be executed next Wednesday for conspiring to traffic 1 kilogram of cannabis; he has been denied access to justice, according to anti-death penalty activists. Singapore executed 11 people last year for drug offenses, but critics argue that the death penalty has mostly snared low-level mules and done little to stop drug traffickers and organized syndicates. This case has brought Singapore's capital punishment under deeper scrutiny; however, Singapore's government defends it as necessary to protect its citizens.

## Washington State Bans Sale and Manufacturing of Semi-Automatic Guns
Washington State has passed a law banning the sale, distribution, manufacture and importation of more than 50 gun models, including AR-15s, AK-47s and similar style rifles. Despite opposition from Republican lawmakers, the measures were approved to reduce gun violence. Governor Jay Inslee said that the state will no longer accept gun violence as normal. The law includes exemptions for sales to law enforcement and military but does not bar possession by those who already have them. The ban is similar to those enacted in nine other states, including California and New York.
