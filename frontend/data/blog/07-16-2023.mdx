## Judge upholds Oregon gun permit law and ban on large capacity magazines
A U.S. District Judge ruled that Oregon's law requiring a permit to purchase a gun and banning large capacity magazines aligns with the nation's history of regulating dangerous firearm features to protect public safety. The ruling comes after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment that has caused confusion over firearm restrictions. The decision is expected to be appealed and may reach the U.S. Supreme Court.
