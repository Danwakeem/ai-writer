## Judge denies Trump's request for new trial in E. Jean Carroll defamation case
A federal judge in New York denies former President Donald Trump's request for a new trial in the defamation and battery case brought by E. Jean Carroll. The judge states that the jury's verdict was not erroneous or a miscarriage of justice. Carroll's attorney looks forward to receiving the $5 million in damages awarded by the jury. Trump's attorneys argued for a new trial on damages, stating that the jury did not find rape but rather sexual abuse. The trial originated from Carroll's defamation lawsuit against Trump in 2019.
