## U.S. B-52 bombers fly over Korean Peninsula in drill with South Korea
Long-range bombers from the United States take part in joint drills alongside South Korean and U.S. fighter jets over the Korean Peninsula. The military exercises demonstrate the readiness of the South Korea-U.S. alliance to respond to any provocation by North Korea with overwhelming force. North Korea views these drills as an indication of potential attacks against them. In response to North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, the U.S. and South Korea have been expanding their combined military drills, including naval, anti-submarine and field exercises, raising concerns of a potential conflict.

## Zelenskyy awarded Poland’s highest civilian honor during trip to thank country for support
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was awarded Poland's highest civilian award, The Order of the White Eagle, by Polish President Duda during a visit to Warsaw. Zelenskyy thanked Poland for their support and met with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and some of the Ukrainians who have found refuge in Poland. However, the visit comes at a delicate time as Polish farmers are becoming increasingly angry since Ukrainian grain entering Poland is causing prices to fall. In Ukraine, Russian forces launched 47 airstrikes and three missile strikes over the previous 24 hours, leaving four civilians dead and 16 others wounded.

## Biden to visit Ireland and Northern Ireland to celebrate peace accord anniversary
US President Joe Biden will visit Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to mark the anniversary of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. The visit will celebrate the deep ties the US has with Ireland, and highlight US readiness to support Northern Ireland’s economic potential. Biden is proud of his Irish heritage and wants to visit Ireland, despite recent heightened terrorism concerns. The Windsor Framework was praised by Biden as an important step in maintaining the peace accord, but it has been called for changes by Northern Ireland’s political leaders. Biden's trip will not be the first by US president to visit Belfast but will be celebrated in a much different climate.

## Police investigate misuse of funds in Scottish independence campaign
Police in Scotland have been investigating the use of £600,000 of funds that were designated for the Scottish independence campaign. This investigation could be detrimental to the SNP's political status, as well as to former party chief executive Peter Murrell, who resigned due to the debacle over the party’s declining membership and the contest to replace Nicola Sturgeon. Sturgeon resigned in February, and a referendum next October would question Scottish independence. Police were also present in front of the SNP headquarters in Edinburgh and the couple’s Glasgow home.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is in intensive care at a hospital in Milan due to an unresolved problem related to a previous infection. Berlusconi has had several health issues in recent years, including recovering from COVID-19 in 2020 and undergoing heart surgery in 2016. He remains at the helm of the center-right party he created in the early 1990s, though the day-to-day running of the party has been left to underlings.

## Bond Market Yields Sink as Reports of Slowing Economy Emerge
Reports show that the slowing pace of the U.S. services sector, the job market, and pay raises of workers has caused yields in the bond market to sink. The economy is currently slowing down after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to control inflation. If the job market continues to slow, it may lead to pausing hikes in interest rates or even rate cuts. The Fed has hiked interest rates at one of the fastest paces ever over the past year, making this a major event for traders.

## Lori Lightfoot’s successor as mayor of Chicago is chosen in a narrow victory against Paul Vallas
Lori Lightfoot has not secured a second term in Chicago but the new mayor will be the Democrat candidate, Lori Lightfoot’s former police superintendent, David Brown Johnson, who won by 51% to 49% over former CEO of Chicago Public Schools, Paul Vallas, in a very tight election. Johnson was backed by leading Democrats such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and campaigned on progressive issues, such as redirecting resources to social needs. Vallas had the support of the Fraternal Order of Police and leading Democrats such as former Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, and former U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. The election was noteworthy for an exceptionally low voter count, with only 33% of eligible voters actually casting a ballot.
