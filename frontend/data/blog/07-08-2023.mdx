## Summer avalanche kills hiker and injures two others in California
A hiker died and two others were injured after encountering a wet slide avalanche while descending Split Mountain in California. The avalanche did not bury the hikers but was strong enough to sweep them onto rocky terrain. Rescue teams were deployed and were able to save the survivors but had to wait another day to retrieve the body of the deceased hiker due to challenging conditions. This is the second avalanche-related fatality in the Sierra in the last month. The Eastern Sierra Avalanche Center has issued a warning about the likelihood of avalanches, particularly due to loose, unconsolidated snow on the surface and melting snow bridges.

## UPS Workers Edge Closer to Strike Amid Breakdown in Talks with Teamsters Union
Negotiations between UPS and the Teamsters union have reached a stalemate, bringing the possibility of a strike closer. The strike would have far-reaching consequences for the economy, as UPS employs 340,000 workers who deliver a significant portion of the country's packages. The union is seeking improved pay and the elimination of a two-tier wage system. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters contends that UPS walked away from negotiations, while UPS claims the opposite. The union emphasizes the importance of this fight for its members, highlighting low wages for part-time workers and the role they play in the company's success. The union is also seeking recognition for part-timers who worked through the pandemic without hazard pay. The Teamsters believe that UPS has an opportunity to do the right thing and become a model employer in the country.
