## Ohio public pension fund loses millions in Silicon Valley Bank collapse
Ohio's State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) suffered a multi-million dollar loss after holding over $27 million in Silicon Valley Bank shares. The losses come as a repercussion of the financial crisis that caused the 16th largest bank in the U.S. to collapse, along with Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank. Pension funds in North Carolina and California were also impacted, but to a much lesser extent. STRS only held .03% of its total fund in Silicon Valley Bank shares.

## Poland and Slovakia provide Ukraine with fighter jets, Russia criticizes NATO's involvement
Poland has announced that it will deliver a dozen MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. Slovakia will also provide undisclosed military equipment in exchange for the MiGs it is giving to Ukraine. Ukraine had repeatedly asked NATO members for military aid; this was met by reluctance, as allies feared escalating the conflict. Russia has complained about NATO's increased involvement in the Ukraine conflict, describing the provision of military aid as a harmful move. Slovakia's opposition parties rejected the decision and threatened to sue the government.

## Remembering Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Law clerks, officials and others honor late justice at Supreme Court ceremony
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second female member of the Supreme Court who served as a justice for 27 years, was honored at a meeting of the Supreme Court Bar and special court session, a tradition following a justice's death.

She became an icon to young women as the senior liberal on the court and earned the nickname the “Notorious RBG.” Ginsburg is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

## Is DeSantis modeling himself after Trump for the 2024 presidential campaign?
DeSantis, a top Republican presidential candidate, is gaining momentum in national politics but his guarded approach and lack of personal connections may become an issue in winning the Republican nomination. While Trump maximizes his unscripted moments with voters and media coverage, DeSantis relies more on a campaign strategy that won him Florida's re-election. DeSantis' allies believe he will become more accessible to voters and maintain unscripted appearances. Though many perceive it as a risky move, Republican political analysts believe that DeSantis' strategy may resonate with Republican voters.

## Minnesota Republican opposes guaranteeing meals for students because he 'has yet to meet a person in Minnesota who is hungry'
Minnesota State Senator Steve Drazkowski opposed a bill that would provide meals for all students, citing the fact that he hasn't met a hungry person in Minnesota. However, almost 275,000 K-12 Minnesota students are on free or reduced meals and one in six are food insecure, meaning they don't know when their next meal will be available. The bill's author, Democratic-Farmer-Labor Sen. Heather Gustafson, argued that being hungry makes learning almost impossible and that the proposed increase accounts for less than one percent of the state's education budget. The bill passed the state senate and Governor Tim Walz plans to sign it into law.

## Nicaraguan political prisoners call on Biden administration to renew TPS
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega’s government has freed 222 people, including opposition leader Yubrank Suazo, from prison and sent them to the US. The US short-term Protected Status (TPS) was first granted to Nicaraguans following Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Only those Nicaraguan immigrants who resided in the US before 1999 are shielded under the programme from the threat of deportation. Suazo and other supporters of the extension are calling on the Biden administration to redesignate TPS to extend it to thousands more Nicaraguans.
