## US jobless claims rise slightly but remain at healthy levels
US jobless claims for the week ending May 27 increased by 2,000 to 232,000, but still indicate a strong labor market. The four-week moving average of claims fell by 2,500 to 229,500. The Fed's interest rate policy strategy may be cooling the job market, as February and March job figures were revised lower by 149,000. Analysts predict that US employers added 188,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate remaining at 3.4%.

## Amazon employees stage walkout over company policies
Nearly 2,000 Amazon employees signed a petition and staged a walkout to protest against the company's return-to-work policy and impact on the climate. The employee activism follows a series of layoffs in recent months. After the walkout, Amazon estimated that 300 workers had participated in the protest. The walkout among Amazon employees, which appears to be made up predominantly of corporate workers, comes more than a year after warehouse workers at a Staten Island facility protested against working conditions during the pandemic.

## FDA Warns Against Off-Brand Versions of Popular Weight-Loss Drugs
The FDA warns against using compounded versions of semaglutide, the active ingredient in the popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, due to safety and effectiveness concerns. Compounded drugs are not FDA-approved and may contain unapproved versions of semaglutide. Sales of semaglutide products have risen in recent years due to their significant weight-loss properties, causing a shortage of supply. Consumers should only use FDA-approved drugs containing semaglutide with a prescription from a licensed professional.
