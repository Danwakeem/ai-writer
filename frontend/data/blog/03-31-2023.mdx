## Justice Department files lawsuit against Norfolk Southern over Ohio train derailment
The US Justice Department has launched a civil lawsuit against Norfolk Southern over a train crash which took place last month in Ohio. The suit was launched on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, which is seeking injunctive relief and monetary penalties from Norfolk Southern for the costs associated with the crash's aftermath. The DOJ claims that the company is responsible for discharging pollutants and oil into local waterways as well as reducing spending on repairs and maintenance. The complaint asks for a judge to order Norfolk Southern to pay civil penalties of $64,618 per each day it violated provisions of the Clean Water Act and another $55,808 per day or $2,232 per barrel of oil or unit of hazardous substances spilled.

## Inflation remains a concern for the US economy as prices rise again in February
The latest figures from the Commerce Department show that inflation pressures continue to grip the US economy. While inflation eased slightly from January, year-over-year prices are still 5%, which is above the Fed's 2% target. Consumer spending has also dropped from a 2% increase in January to 0.2% in February. Financial analysts are still uncertain about the inflation outlook, but many believe the Fed has to keep up its efforts to keep it under control.
