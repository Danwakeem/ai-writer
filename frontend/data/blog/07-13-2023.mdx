## Celsius Network Founder Arrested on Federal Charges
Alexander Mashinsky, the founder of Celsius Network, has been arrested on federal charges. Mashinsky is accused of misrepresenting the financial health of Celsius before it collapsed into bankruptcy. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have filed lawsuits stating that Mashinsky falsely promised investors a safe investment with high returns. They also alleged that Celsius' own crypto asset security was fraudulently manipulated. The alleged scheme unraveled in June 2022, leaving investors unable to withdraw billions of dollars in crypto assets from Celsius' online platform.

## Producer price index rises by smallest amount since August 2020
The government's producer price index, which measures inflation before it reaches consumers, rose just 0.1% last month, marking the smallest increase since August 2020. The index reflects prices charged by manufacturers, farmers, and wholesalers and can indicate how fast consumer inflation will rise. Despite the lower inflation numbers, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise its benchmark rate in two weeks but may hold off on another rate hike in September if inflation continues to cool.

## Delta Air Lines Reports Record Quarterly Profit Amid Strong Demand for Tickets
Delta Air Lines has announced a record quarterly profit of over $1.8 billion, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The airline's revenue has been boosted by strong demand for tickets, particularly on international routes, and falling fuel prices. Delta officials have raised their forecast for full-year earnings and expect continued strong revenue into the next quarter. Despite caution from some analysts regarding the recovery of business travel, Delta's CEO, Ed Bastian, remains confident that corporate travel will steadily grow. The airline is targeting high-income travelers, who account for three-fourths of all spending on air travel. Delta's revenue from premium seats and services increased by 25% in the second quarter. While labor costs have risen significantly, Delta's cancellation rate has been better than average and operations are expected to improve throughout the summer. The airline's profit for the quarter was $1.8 billion, a new record, and its adjusted profit per share exceeded analysts' expectations. Delta's full-year earnings per share forecast has been raised to between $6 and $7. Revenue rose by 13% to $15.58 billion, with international travel outpacing domestic growth.
