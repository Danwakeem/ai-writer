## Three women missing for 2 weeks after trip to Mexico for shopping
Authorities are searching for three women who went missing in Mexico. They were last seen on February 25th during a shopping trip. Two of the women are from the United States and the other is a friend. The US authorities have not intervened yet as the women are Mexican nationals. Search operations are being carried out daily using drones, all-terrain vehicles, and canines. The families believe the disappearance occurred in the neighboring state, and the authorities are coordinating with them for a stronger search. Anyone with information is urged to contact the FBI or the Peñitas Police Department.

## Nearly 24-hour long standoff continues after deputies were met with gunfire in Los Angeles County
A home in Valinda was reported for an 'assault with a deadly weapon'. When LAPD deputies arrived, the suspect fired at them leading to a shootout, which resulted in the suspect barricading himself for 24 hours with ongoing negotiation attempts. No one has been struck by gunfire during the ordeal, but one female victim was taken to the hospital for a non-gunshot related injury. The standoff continues to develop as talks with the suspect have thus far proven unsuccessful in deescalating the situation. Red Cross and police have organized a shelter for those displaced.

## The natural phenomenon in Hawaii that has deep spiritual and cultural significance to the Native Hawaiians
Seismic activity beneath the summit of Kilauea in Hawaii has returned to background levels and no lava has been observed at the surface, but the U.S. Geological Survey agency cautioned that another intrusion or resumption may occur in the near future without warning. This followed 61 days of volcanic activity that had stopped flowing. Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanos that destroyed more than 700 residences after its 2018 eruption. Native Hawaiians honor the deity of volcanoes and fire, Pele, when volcanic eruptions occur, with traditional ceremonies including singing, chanting, and dancing as well as offering known as “hookupu.”

## NASA's Nicole Mann Leads First All-Person-Of-Color Space Mission
NASA Astronaut Nicole Mann became the first Native American woman to fly in space among a U.S.-Russian-Japanese crew that had dodged space junk, leaking Russian capsules and an urgent delivery of spacecraft for the station's crew. Mann led the mission that lasted five months at the International Space Station, returning early Saturday morning in a SpaceX Dragon capsule that splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico near the Florida coast. Led by Nicole Mann, the U.S-led crew included Russian cosmonauts Anna Kikina and Sergei Ryazansky and Japan's Koichi Wakata. The crew were greeted by SpaceX personnel aboard its recovery ship minutes after splashdown. The remaining crew members are three Americans, three Russians and one from the United Arab Emirates.

## Relativity Space’s rocket launch aborted twice in a row
Relativity Space's rocket launch named Terran was aborted twice due to automation software and low fuel pressure. The rocket is relatively small and 85% of it came out of the company's huge 3D printers in Long Beach, California. Only the company's first 3D metal print is aboard the rocket for this test flight, and the goal is to put it and the second stage into a low, short-lived orbit. There's no word on when the company will attempt to launch the rocket again.
