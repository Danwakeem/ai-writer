## Mass Killings are Happening More Frequently in the US in 2021
Mass killings in the US are occurring at an average of once every 6.53 days this year, with 88 lives lost in 17 mass killings over 111 days, according to data analyses. These have included shootings at grade schools, farms, and parties, as well as revenge attacks motivated by revenge, gang violence and workplace vendettas. There seems to be little appetite from Congress to reinstate a ban on semi-automatic rifles, and little action from the vast majority of states. Gun control advocates warn of the proliferation of guns and record sales during the height of the pandemic.

## UK Deputy Prime Minister Resigns Following Bullying Accusations
Dominic Raab, the UK’s deputy prime minister, has resigned following two findings of bullying against him in a 48-page report; the investigation dismissed other claims against him. The Ministerial Code of Conduct requires ministers to treat people with respect and not tolerate harassment, discrimination or bullying. Raab denied accusations of belittling and demeaning his staff, stating that he behaved professionally at all times, however, he resigned because he had promised to do so if the bullying claims were substantiated. The timing of the announcement spared UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak the difficult task of deciding Raab’s fate. Sunak also referred to “shortcomings” in the investigation which had “negatively affected everyone involved.”

## Twitter removes 'government-funded media' labels following backlash
Twitter has abolished the labels that described media organizations as government-funded or state-affiliated. Amongst those no longer labelled was National Public Radio in the United States, which announced that it would cease using the social media platform for that reason. In addition to National Public Radio, Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and Swedish public radio have made similar decisions to quit tweeting. Verifications on Twitter since 2006 have been provided for the purpose of confirming profiles as authentic, but Musk has sought to change their relevance after launching a subscription that included the service.

## Investors challenge Swiss regulatory order after $17.3 billion loss in high-risk Credit Suisse bonds
Credit Suisse investors are disputing an order by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) that eradicated about $17.3bn in high-risk bonds as part of an emergency rescue last month. The lawsuit was filed in Swiss federal court following the bond losses. Although FINMA declined to comment on the case, the regulator has stated that the action taken was the best option, which minimised the risk of fanning a broader crisis and damaging Switzerland's reputation as a financial centre.

## Attorneys General call for recall of Kia and Hyundai models after increase in thefts following social media challenge
Attorneys general from 18 US states have called for a recall of select Kia and Hyundai models manufactured between 2011 and 2022 due to an increase in the theft of these vehicles following a social media challenge. The thefts have been linked to several deaths and injuries, which suggests that the voluntary service campaign by Hyundai and Kia is not enough. The carmakers have contacted over 2 million owners to inform them of software updates, while Hyundai has made engine immobilizers standard on all recent vehicles produced. Hyundais and Kias accounted for a significant percentage of stolen cars in several US cities in 2022.

## Dangerous chemicals found in contaminated water supply in 43% of U.S. ZIP codes
A recent analysis has revealed that 43% of the United States' ZIP codes have had at least one water supply contaminated with Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) over the past 20 years. These synthetic chemicals can increase health risks when exposure occurs at high levels, and PCBs have been linked to a range of issues such as kidney cancer and high cholesterol. Unfortunately, exposure to PFASs is higher in ZIP codes that have a lower median income and a higher non-white population which could impact as many as 143 million Americans. Despite the EPA's October 2021 plan to address the issue, key deadlines have been missed.
