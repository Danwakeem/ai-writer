## Deep sea mining regulations delayed as International Seabed Authority fails to meet deadline
The International Seabed Authority, a UN agency, did not approve regulations for deep sea mining by the July 9 deadline. No licenses have been issued, and no applications have been received yet. However, the government of Nauru is expected to apply soon. Nauru aims to diversify its economy but did not submit an application during the UN conference.

## Legal Battle Delays Construction of Geothermal Power Plant
Environmentalists and tribal leaders have succeeded in triggering a third review of a partially built geothermal power plant in Nevada. The Bureau of Land Management previously approved the project, but the decision has been reversed due to flaws in the environmental review. It is unclear if the agency will conduct a supplemental analysis or start a completely new review. This means it will be months or potentially over a year before construction of the power plant can resume. The project is being challenged due to its potential adverse impact on a critical habitat for an endangered toad.
