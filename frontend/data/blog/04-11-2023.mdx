## China warns Taiwan with military drills after US House Speaker visit
Large-scale Chinese military drills since Friday are believed to be retaliation for the meeting between the US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen last week.

## Pirates board ship off Ivory Coast's capital. Are crew members kidnapped or is there cargo theft?
Pirates boarded the Success 9 ship, sailing approximately 300 nautical miles southwest of Ivory Coast's capital. It's uncertain how many pirates were involved or how many crew members were on board the tanker. There are two possible explanations for this incident, kidnap and ransom or cargo theft. Gulf of Guinea is the most dangerous spot in the world for ship attacks. The United Nations Security Council has already condemned piracy, armed robbery and hostage-taking. Another piracy incident happened in Danish-owned oil tanker last March.

## North Korea's Kim Jong Un reviews frontline attack plans, stresses need to bolster nuclear deterrent
North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, along with the ruling Workers' Party's Central Military Commission, analysed the situation on the Korean Peninsula following the US-South Korean joint military drills, which they view as invasion rehearsals. The commission's members discussed strengthening defence capacities and perfecting war preparations to counter the threat posed by the allied drills. Kim reviewed the country's frontline attack plans and stressed the need to bolster the country's nuclear deterrent with an increasing speed on a more practical and offensive manner. The communication between North and South via military hotline has been cut, with the South claiming North Korea cut off communications after the South urged North Korea to stop using Korean assets without permission from a joint factory park in the North Korean Kaesong region. Experts suggest that Kim's provocative run on weapons displays is aimed at forcing the US to negotiate economic concessions from a position of strength.
