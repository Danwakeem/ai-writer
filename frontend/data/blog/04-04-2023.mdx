## Pro-Russian hacker group claims responsiblity for cyberattack on Finland's parliament following NATO membership
A pro-Russian hacker group known as NoName057 claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on the Finnish Parliament's website after Finland joined NATO. The attack caused the site to be hard to use and some functions to be unavailable for a time, but the claim could not be verified. Finland became the 31st member of NATO, with few outward signs of geopolitical shift aside from the Finnish and NATO flags being raised alongside national flags. Defense Minister Antti Kaikkonen said this was historically significant for Finland, which had never been militarily aligned before.

Khalid 'Aydd Ahmad Al-Jabouri, an ISIS senior leader responsible for planning attacks in Europe and Turkey, was killed in a US strike in northwest Syria.

## TikTok Receives a $15.9 Million Fine in the UK for Breaching Data Privacy Laws
The UK Information Commissioner’s Office imposed a $15.9 million fine on the short-video sharing app TikTok for failing to protect the privacy of its young users. The watchdog's investigation unraveled data breaches and allowed 1.4 million children aged under 13 to use TikTok, raising concerns in cybersecurity and data privacy. Although TikTok invested heavily to keep underage users off the site, the ICO was not persuaded by its defenses. TikTok plans to contest the decision and improve its sign-up system to detect age misrepresentation.
