## China's Xi Jinping visits Russia in show of support amid tensions with the West
Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting Russia on his first foreign trip since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a visit seen as support for Russia amid tensions with the West, Xi wrote in a Russian newspaper that the friendship between the two countries is strengthening. The two leaders met at the Kremlin and discussed their countries' strategic partnership. The meeting was informal but focused on direct and important conversations. Their meeting comes after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian military officer, causing tensions between Russia and Ukraine to increase.

## EU pledges 108 million euros at Brussels donors' conference for Turkey, Syria
The president of the EU's executive arm, Ursula von der Leyen, pledged 108 million euros in humanitarian aid for Syria at a donors' conference in Brussels to raise money for both Turkey and Syria. The earthquake in Turkey on Feb. 6 killed more than 52,000 people, and the majority of Turkey's 300,000 severely damaged buildings need to be reconstructed. Survivors of the earthquake in rebel-held northwest Syria have also received very little assistance due to deep divisions. The EU has been providing humanitarian aid to Syria since 2011 but does not intend to help with reconstruction in the war-torn country due to EU sanctions against the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad.

## States are imposing harsher prison sentences for drug possession due to the fentanyl crisis
Several states are implementing tougher penalties for those found possessing drugs containing fentanyl, with some sentencing drug dealers but also potentially punishing low-level users. Recovery advocates and some lawmakers are warning that treating drug addiction as a criminal issue historically has failed, helping drive the opioid epidemic. However, with overdose deaths rising due to the potent drug fentanyl, jurisdictions are taking a hard stance on drugs, even if it poses unintended consequences.

## Iowa Governor's push to limit LGBTQ content raises concerns
As Republican Governor Kim Reynolds seeks to crack down on content in Iowa school libraries, there is a divide over LGBTQ content in books. The move comes amid fears that it is part of a backlash by those who don't acknowledge LGBTQ people, and efforts to limit discussion about it. At the same time, a push by Republican Attorney General Jeff Landry in Louisiana to investigate sexually explicit materials in public libraries could restrict children and teens’ access to those books, including those that have LGBTQ storylines.
