## Justice Department seeks 25-year prison sentence for Oath Keepers founder
The Justice Department has requested a 25-year sentence for Oath Keepers founder, Stewart Rhodes, due to his role in organizing members of the far-right militia for the Capitol attack on January 6th. The recommendation, which is the longest so far for any person charged in connection with the attack, comes from prosecutors who want to use a terrorism enhancement to urge a judge to accept an upward departure from typical sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors argue that all nine defendants in the case were active participants in a conspiracy to oppose the lawful transfer of presidential power through intimidation and coercion.
