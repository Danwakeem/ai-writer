## Tiger Woods Withdraws From Masters, Citing Plantar Fasciitis
Tiger Woods has withdrawn from the Masters due to plantar fasciitis, citing discomfort in his right foot. This comes after limping through practice rounds earlier in the week and during the first and second rounds of the competition. Woods finished his second round in cold, driving rain on Sunday to make the cut, but by the end of play was alone in last place, 22 shots behind leader Brooks Koepka. The five-time champion will now have to wait and see if he is fit enough to play in upcoming tournaments, such as the PGA Championship in May.

He appealed to political actors and the international community to seek a definitive solution to the many problems that afflict that sorely tried people.

## Two Philadelphia schools close due to asbestos concerns
The School District of Philadelphia has announced the immediate closure of two schools due to the discovery of asbestos in their buildings. The district has been conducting a review of records following the discovery of asbestos in two other district buildings. The district stated that most of the buildings' plaster had 'no asbestos detected' according to 1990s records. However, new sampling has shown that certain plaster walls and ceilings do contain asbestos. Asbestos was commonly used in building materials for insulation and as a fire retardant, and is a health concern when it is released into the air and can be inhaled. The closure of the two schools is not an indication of the program failing, but rather the program is working to protect health and safety through the identification and management of environmental concerns.
