## US unemployment rate falls to 3.5%, leading to possibility of easing inflation and eventual interest rate pause by Fed
The US unemployment rate reached a 53-year low at 3.5%, indicating an ease in inflationary pressures and raises the possibility that the Fed might pause its rate hikes. The average hourly wage increase slowed down sharply at 4.2% versus a year-over-year increase of 4.6% in February, leading to the belief of wage-pressure easing. Although job growth is still robust across several sectors, some categories have seen a decline, such as construction and manufacturing. Meanwhile, Walmart has committed to automations that could lead to jobs demanding less physical labor, but higher pay.

## New Hampshire firm proposes farm for Atlantic salmon, steelhead trout
New Hampshire-based Blue Water Fisheries wants to place 40 submersible fish pens in water about 7.5 miles off Newburyport that would grow millions of pounds of Atlantic salmon, steelhead trout and also includes a proposal to aquaculture lumpfish. The project needs various approvals and the aquaculture project would submerge pens 15 metres below the surface in depths of about 80 metres, but fears persist over pollution and fish escapes that could threaten wild salmon stocks, albeit proponents say it helps to take pressure off of wild fish stocks.
