## IRS Collects $38 Million in Delinquent Taxes, Pursues High-Income Taxpayers
The IRS has revealed that it collected $38 million in delinquent taxes and is pursuing high-income taxpayers. The agency's enhanced ability to identify tax delinquents, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, has contributed to these efforts. The IRS is highlighting the impact of its initiatives in auditing high-income taxpayers and showcasing the value of the Inflation Reduction Act funding, particularly as appropriations season approaches. However, the agency faces challenges, including budget cutbacks and outdated technology. The IRS is gradually automating its systems and exploring innovative ideas, such as a government-operated electronic free-file tax return system. The agency's efforts to improve taxpayer assistance and reduce wait times have yielded mixed results. The IRS's enforcement staff has also decreased by one-third since 2010. The allocation of additional funding to the IRS has been politically contentious since the scrutiny of political groups in 2013.
