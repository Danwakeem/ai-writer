## Turkey's President Erdogan faces possible runoff election after failing to secure outright victory
Preliminary results of the Turkey election show that President Erdogan failed to secure an outright victory, meaning a second round of voting will take place. Erdogan had been predicted to struggle in the polls due to criticism over his government's response to a February earthquake and a cost-of-living crisis. However, he won 49.5% of the vote, with his main rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, winning 44.9%. Erdogan's party also looks set to keep its majority in the parliament. The Ogan camp has yet to say who they will support in the second round.

## Mystery tremors on Danish island: 'not caused by earthquakes'
Tremors felt on the Danish island of Bornholm were 'not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere' according to the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. Although the actual cause of the tremors is unknown, their seismic magnitude was measured at 2.3. There were no reports of injury, although Danish media reported that a house wall was cracked. The Polish military said it had carried out a controlled explosion in the nearby north of the country, but it was unlikely that this was the cause.
