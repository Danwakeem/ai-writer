## Settlement reached in wrongful death suit of cinematographer on Russ film set
The family of Halyna Hutchins has settled their wrongful death lawsuit filed against the Rust film production company and a number of individuals, including Alec Baldwin and the production's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. The terms of the settlement have not been publicly released and were sealed by a judge in April, but documents reveal that Hutchins' 10-year-old son will receive his portion of the settlement in annuities that will be paid out over time when he reaches the ages of 18 and 22.

## May Jobs Report Shows Resilience in Labor Market Despite Mixed Messages
The May jobs report showed that job growth remains robust in a historically tight labor market, though the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% from a five-decade low of 3.4% in April. The average work week declined and wage growth cooled, resulting in an unusually complicated picture of the employment market. Despite this, the government sharply revised up its estimate of job growth in March and April by an additional 93,000 jobs, underscoring the labor marketâ€™s durability. Overall, the economy is still managing to chug ahead despite some cracks in its foundation, but the Fed is expected to forgo a rate increase at its June meeting to assess the impact of previous rate hikes.

## Preliminary hearing dates set in case of elderly man charged with shooting Black teenager
Andrew Lester, an 84-year-old white man, was charged with one count of felony assault in the first-degree and one count of armed criminal action in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, a Black teenager who mistakenly went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. The case has garnered national attention and a protective order has been filed on behalf of Lester to partially seal the case due to negative media attention. Yarl's family has criticized the decision stating that it protects the defendant rather than the victim. A preliminary hearing date has been set for 2023.

Wildfires in Nova Scotia have grown so large that air quality warnings are being issued to regions in the United States as far south as Maryland and Virginia. The province's largest wildfire on record, the Barrington Lake fire, has burned over 75 square miles and has forced over 5,000 people from their homes and cottages.
