## Supreme Court allows legal challenge to Louisiana electoral maps
The US Supreme Court has allowed a legal challenge to go forward against a Louisiana electoral map, which had previously been on hold. The court had previously rejected a congressional redistricting map in Alabama for similar concerns. Both maps had been accused of diluting Black voting power in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. The justices have allowed the Louisiana case to move forward in advance of next year's congressional elections.

## Australia wins case against Russia over site near Parliament House
Australia's High Court has ruled that Russia must vacate a site near Parliament House as its lease was terminated over security grounds. The court dismissed Russia's application for an injunction to hold on to the empty block, with the government's lawyer suggesting that Russia was applying for the injunction to protect its own security and intelligence interests. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese welcomed the ruling and expected the Russians to leave the site. The legal wrangle is a new low point in strained relations between Russia and one of Ukraine's most generous supporters outside NATO. Albanese also announces an additional AUD 110m ($74m) in aid to Ukraine.
