## Texas sues Biden administration over asylum rule using phone app, claiming it encourages illegal immigration
Texas has filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, accusing the use of the CBP One phone app to set up appointments for asylum seekers of encouraging illegal immigration. The lawsuit seeks to have the entire asylum rule, called the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways, thrown out. The state argues that the app doesn't verify whether migrants seeking appointments would qualify for exceptions, therefore potentially encouraging illegal entry. The Biden administration has defended the app, stating that it reduces unlawful immigration.

## Tennessee judge to rule on whether parents of school shooting victims can speak in court
A judge in Tennessee is expected to rule on Wednesday whether parents who lost children in a school shooting can testify in court. The parents are seeking to prevent the journals of the shooter from being made public, arguing that the documents would cause additional harm to the children who survived the attack and could lead to copycat attacks. News organisations, a police group and a firearms association are suing the Nashville Metropolitan Government to get the journals released, cheering they will shed light on the motive for the massacre.

A false claim of an explosion at the Pentagon was spread on Twitter via a fake image and misleading caption, picked up by around 3,785 accounts, some of which were verified.

Police from Portugal, Germany, and Britain are searching for clues at the Arade dam, which is about 50 km from the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz. The operation followed requests by German authorities, and although indications suggest that evidence may be found, police remain cautious. Detectives from the three countries are still trying to piece together what happened on the night that 3-year-old Madeleine disappeared in 2007. An investigation is ongoing into the 45-year-old German citizen Christian Brueckner, who was in Portugal at the time. McCann, who has not been found, is the subject of the fourth search organized for her since the initial one in 2007.
