## US jobless claims rise to  highest in a year-and-a-half, but job market remains strong
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose to its highest level in a year-and-a-half with many companies cutting costs amid the slowing economy. However, most economists do not anticipate widespread layoffs as employers have put a premium on retaining workers. The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes aimed at cooling the job market and preventing rising wages may slow down amid signs of a cooling labor market, but the Fed is hoping to achieve a soft landing without causing a recession later this year. There have been increasing high-profile layoffs, mostly in the technology sector, but companies in other sectors such as McDonald's, Morgan Stanley and 3M have also recently announced layoffs.

## WHO Declares Monkeypox No Longer Global Health Emergency
WHO has declared that the monkeypox outbreak is no longer an acute concern based on the recent dramatic decline in cases in the last three months. Last July, WHO had declared monkeypox to be an extraordinary situation and a global crisis, which was overruled by the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The disease is spread via close physical contact with an infected patient or their clothing or bedsheets and most people don't need medical treatment to recover. Only cases of the disease have spiked by 64% compared to the previous week, with most cases in the Americas and the Western Pacific.

## Yellen urges Congress to find alternative to debt ceiling to avoid financial catastrophe
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that she thinks Congress should find a different system for deciding on fiscal policy, stating that the debt ceiling creates a situation where the country cannot pay its bills. Yellen has urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default on the national debt. She believes that there is no good alternative to raising the debt ceiling and that a default would have dreadful consequences. The White House analysis has found that a default would cost the economy 500,000 jobs or even 8.3 million jobs if the situation persisted. One idea discussed for raising the debt ceiling would be invoking the 14th amendment of the Constitution, but Yellen called it legally questionable and not a short-term solution.
