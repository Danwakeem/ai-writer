## Families of victims killed at the University of Idaho may sue city, documents say
The families of two students killed in the University of Idaho killings last fall reserve their right to sue the city of Moscow according to documents filed with the city. The families may seek damages against the city for the murders of their daughters. No lawsuit has been filed, but the claims protect the families' rights to sue within two years. An attorney representing the families says the tort claims notices are a safeguard. The families had expressed frustration with the investigation and lack of transparency. Four students including the two victims were found stabbed to death at their off-campus house on Nov. 13 by officers responding at the scene. Bryan Kohberger, a 28-year-old criminology Ph.D. student at nearby Washington State University was arrested on Dec. 30 in Pennsylvania in connection with the murder.

## Department of Homeland Security announces body-worn camera policy for all law enforcement components
The Department of Homeland Security has implemented a body-worn camera policy for its nine law enforcement divisions, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The policy outlines when law enforcement officers should wear body-worn cameras to gain the public's trust. However, the policy is unlikely to apply to Secret Service agents on the White House grounds. The policy states that body-worn cameras will not be used in cases of First Amendment protected activity, systemic, indiscriminate tracking, and unauthorized surveillance, among others. Agencies under DHS have 180 days to develop or update their policies on the use of body-worn cameras.
