## Unrest reported at two Alaskan volcanoes on uninhabited island
Elevated earthquake activity has been reported at the Tanaga and Takawangha volcanoes on Tanaga Island. An eruption could be very disruptive to air travel and respiratory systems, but scientists are unsure at this stage which of the volcanoes would be the source of an eruption, or whether it will happen at all. Having two volcanoes this close and both in a state of unrest is very unusual in Alaska.

## West Virginia Senate passes bill to ban marriage of anyone under 16
The West Virginia Senate has voted to prohibit anyone under 16 from getting married, with consent required from parents for those aged 16 and 17. A Senate bill also mandates that children cannot marry anybody more than four years older than themselves. The bill would bring the state in line with the majority of others in the US. Written into the legislation is an exemption for existing legal marriages, including those from other states. Figures from 2014 showed West Virginia had the US's most child marriages, according to the Pew Research Center.

## Lawsuit filed against woman for self-administered abortion
A lawsuit has been filed by Marcus Silva, seeking $1m in damages, after allegedly assisting in a self-administered abortion, claiming it is aiding a murder. Silva is being represented by conservative legal group Thomas More Society and state Representative Briscoe Cain. The woman who took the medication is not named in the lawsuit and Texas law protects women who get an abortion from being held liable. According to the suit, the manufacturer of the pills will also be named as a defendant once it is identified. Abortion rights groups condemned the lawsuit, calling it an intimidation tactic.

## "We don't feel safe anymore": Ohio community still haunted by train disaster, fears of long-term health risks
Residents of East Palestine, Ohio, are still struggling a month after a train derailed and spilled hazardous chemicals, including vinyl chloride, which authorities later had to burn off to prevent an explosion. The community was evacuated and upon returning home, many noted physical symptoms, such as irritable skin and respiratory problems. Now, with the government and Norfolk Southern telling them the air and water are safe, but still not reporting how much vinyl chloride was released, residents are left wondering what the long-term ramifications of the accident might be. Some are calling for the railroad company to buy out homes and help residents move away from the toxic area.
