A recent MIT Sloan School of Management study found that credit card spending can stimulate the brain's reward center and drive people to make more purchases, leading to increased debt.

If you're in debt, consider consolidating with a balance transfer (with a good credit score) or meeting with a nonprofit credit counseling agency.
