## Temecula Valley Unified School District Approves LGBT Curriculum After Threat of Fine
The Temecula Valley Unified School District has approved an LGBT curriculum after being threatened with a fine by California Governor Newsom. The curriculum includes teaching about gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans, but the board has recommended substituting age-appropriate material for elementary school grades. The board's decision was not in response to the threat, but to avoid a lawsuit. Governor Newsom criticized those who opposed the curriculum, stating that it was about extremists wanting to control information and censor teaching materials.

## Photo of Mississippi senator wearing tutu misused in divisive GOP primary
A photo of Mississippi State Sen. Chad England, wearing a tutu in support of Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, has been misused in the increasingly divisive GOP primary. The image was posted on Twitter with a derogatory comment, leading England to speak out against the dirty politics in the race. The term 'groomer' used in the comment has political implications as it is often associated with sex offenders. Hosemann faces two challengers in the primary, and if no majority is won, there will be a runoff on Aug. 29. England, who initially supported one of Hosemann's opponents, now endorses Hosemann and claims to have received a threatening text message with the photo. Another supporter of Hosemann also shared a similar photo on Twitter, which has since been taken down. England has used the incident to revive his fundraising efforts for breast cancer research. Some have criticized the tone of the text exchange between England and the person who sent the photo, but England alleges that it was a threat. The McDaniel campaign, one of Hosemann's opponents, has distanced itself from the incident and stated that they cannot control every volunteer on social media. This comes after a controversial incident during the 2014 U.S. Senate campaign involving McDaniel supporters entering a nursing home without permission and photographing the wife of then-incumbent Thad Cochran, who had dementia. The lieutenant governorship in Mississippi is a powerful position, as the person presides over the state Senate and has authority over legislation.
