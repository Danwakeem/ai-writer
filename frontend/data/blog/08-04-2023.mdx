## Disgraced crypto executive faces potential bail revocation and detention
Prosecutors argue that Sam Bankman-Fried should have his bail revoked and be detained before his trial for fraud and conspiracy charges. Bankman-Fried is accused of sharing personal documents of a trial witness with the New York Times, with prosecutors claiming that it was an attempt to affect public perception of her. The defense denies the allegations and argues that the government's claims are based on assumptions and unsupported inferences. Prosecutors also accuse Bankman-Fried of witness tampering.

## US job market remains resilient as unemployment rate dips to 3.5%
US employers added 187,000 jobs in July, slightly below expectations. However, the unemployment rate decreased to 3.5%, indicating the job market's resilience. Despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, more Americans entered the workforce, alleviating pressure on employers to raise wages. Average hourly wages rose 0.4% from June and 4.4% from a year earlier, which may worry the Fed. Economists express confidence in a 'soft landing' for the US economy. However, the job market is showing signs of losing momentum as job openings decrease and the pace of hiring cools off.
